# Claude Code Session Management

## üö® FILE SIZE ENFORCEMENT - READ THIS FIRST! üö®

**CRITICAL**: Before creating ANY new file, follow these rules to prevent size violations:

### File Size Limits (ENFORCED by pre-commit hook)
- **Code files**: Maximum 200 lines
- **Test files**: Maximum 300 lines  
- **Target size**: ~100 lines for optimal AI comprehension

### Prevention Strategies (USE THESE ALWAYS)
1. **Before writing a large function**: Break it into smaller functions first
2. **Before creating a new file**: Ask yourself: "Can this be split into 2-3 focused modules?"
3. **When approaching 150 lines**: Stop and refactor into separate modules
4. **Use existing utilities**: Check `lib/`, `utils/`, `helpers/` folders for reusable code
5. **Extract common patterns**: Create utility functions instead of copying code

### Quick Module Structure Patterns
```
# Instead of one large file:
large-handler.js (250 lines) ‚ùå

# Use focused modules:
handlers/
  main-handler.js (80 lines) ‚úÖ
  validators.js (60 lines) ‚úÖ
  lib/
    common-utils.js (40 lines) ‚úÖ
```

### Emergency Prevention Command
If file is getting large during development:
```bash
wc -l filename.js  # Check line count immediately
```

**REMEMBER**: It's 10x easier to write small files than to refactor large ones later!

## Auto-Loading Session Context (DEPRECATED)
<!-- DEPRECATED: MCP server functionality replaced by Claude Projects built-in context management
**COGITO AUTO-LOAD**: Session context is automatically loaded on startup when enabled.
-->

## Auto-Generated Database Schema
**AUTOMATIC**: Database schema is automatically dumped to `docs/database-schema-current.md` in multiple ways:
1. Via `.claude-init` script (if Claude supports project init scripts)
2. Manually via `node scripts/dump-database-schema.js`
3. Via shell integration: `source scripts/claude-startup.sh`

The schema dump provides Claude with current database structure including:
- All tables, columns, types, and constraints
- Foreign key relationships
- Indexes and unique constraints
- Schema ownership and sources (Supabase vs User-created)

## Auto-Loading Architecture Documentation
**RECOMMENDED SESSION STARTUP**: Load key INTENTIONS.md files for comprehensive architectural context:

### Core Architecture Files (Load First)
1. **Root System Overview**: `INTENTIONS.md` - Overall system architecture
2. **Database System**: `database/INTENTIONS.md` - DatabaseAgent and operations  
3. **Server System**: `server/INTENTIONS.md` - Express application architecture
4. **Project Instructions**: `CLAUDE.md` - Development conventions and patterns

### Token Budget for Startup
- Core 4 files: ~3,600 tokens
- Additional subsystem files as needed: ~2,000-4,000 tokens
- Remaining for work: ~12,000+ tokens

### Loading Strategy
```bash
# Manual startup sequence:
# 1. Read INTENTIONS.md (system overview)
# 2. Read database/INTENTIONS.md (data layer)  
# 3. Read server/INTENTIONS.md (application layer)
# 4. Read CLAUDE.md (conventions)
# 5. Load additional subsystem files based on work area
```

See `.claude-startup.md` for detailed loading guidance and subsystem file recommendations.

## Session History Available
**IMPORTANT**: Session context files may contain crucial information:
- `session-context.md` in current directory (auto-loaded if present)
- `~/.cogito/sessions/` for historical session files
- Previous sessions auto-loaded by Cogito MCP server (if enabled)
- **NEW**: `exploration-*.md` files contain pre-summary thinking/emerging ideas

Previous sessions may contain:
- Incomplete tasks that need continuation
- Important context about project decisions
- Setup procedures already completed
- Known issues and their solutions
- **Active explorations** not yet crystallized

## Commands (DEPRECATED - MCP Server Functionality)
<!-- MOVED TO DEPRECATED: MCP server functionality replaced by Claude Projects
- `mcp__cogito__load_session_context` - Manually load session context
- `mcp__cogito__configure_session_settings` - Enable/disable auto-loading
- Always check if session context was auto-loaded on startup
- If auto-load is disabled, manually read `session-context.md` when present
- Check for `exploration-*.md` files for emerging ideas
- `intentions.edn` is now auto-loaded on startup for architectural context
-->

## Working Patterns
- **Genealogical development**: Projects grow from each other organically
- **Exploration tracking**: Save pre-summary thinking in exploration files
- **Et al. ecosystem**: Project relationships and emergence patterns
- **Functional evolution**: Incrementally evolve code toward functional patterns
- **Learning over apps**: Build systems that understand how thinking happens rather than just doing tasks
- **Conversational participants**: Transform tools into thinking partners that participate rather than serve

## Session Meeting Architecture
**CRITICAL**: All turns must belong to meetings. Web conversation sessions automatically create meetings:

### Implementation
- **Meeting Creation**: Happens after successful login/client selection (not during initial login)
- **Session Storage**: `meeting_id` stored in `req.session.meeting_id` for automatic turn association
- **Meeting Type**: `'cogito_web'` for web conversation sessions
- **Turn Association**: All conversational turns automatically reference the session meeting

### Code Locations
- **Meeting Creation**: `server/lib/session-meeting.js` - `createSessionMeeting()`
- **Login Integration**: `server/routes/auth.js` - Creates meeting for single-client auto-selection
- **Client Selection**: `server/routes/client-management.js` - Creates meeting after client selection/switching
- **Turn Creation**: `server/routes/conversations.js` - Uses `req.session.meeting_id` instead of request body
- **Frontend**: `src/main/cogito/events.cljs` - No longer sends meeting_id in API calls

### Key Principles
- **Data Integrity**: No orphaned turns - every turn belongs to a meeting
- **Session Isolation**: Each user session gets its own meeting
- **Client Separation**: Switching clients creates a new meeting
- **Automatic Association**: No manual meeting_id handling in frontend

## Architecture and Design Reference
**IMPORTANT**: See `intentions.edn` for comprehensive architectural documentation including:
- Core purpose and design principles
- Feature implementation details with code locations
- Active explorations and technical decisions
- Deprecated patterns to avoid
- Known pain points and success patterns

## Conversational Choreography
**IMPORTANT**: Before responding to any prompt, assess whether asking clarifying questions would significantly improve your response. If so, ask those questions first and wait for the user's answers before providing your main response. If the prompt seems complete or additional context wouldn't meaningfully change your answer, respond directly.

This instruction enables:
- Dynamic multi-question exploration when beneficial
- Natural conversation flow without forced interrogation
- Learning about when clarification adds value vs creates friction
- Development of conversational intelligence and judgment

## Extended Prompt
**ALWAYS**: When receiving a prompt, actively consider whether additional context or information would help deliver a higher quality response. If so, ask for it before proceeding. This can be done multiple times in a conversation as understanding deepens.

Key decision points to probe:
- **Implementation vs Discussion**: "Should we start implementing or do we need to keep discussing/exploring?"
- **Scope clarification**: What are the boundaries and constraints?
- **Context gaps**: What background information would be helpful?
- **Success criteria**: What would make this response most valuable?
- **Approach preferences**: Any specific patterns or methods to follow/avoid?

This promotes:
- Higher quality, more targeted responses
- Reduced rework from misaligned understanding
- Collaborative problem refinement
- Emergence of deeper insights through dialogue

## Schema Change Protocol
**CRITICAL**: Database schema changes require systematic, comprehensive updates to prevent silent failures.

### When Schema Changes Occur:
1. **NEVER be selective** - Update ALL references, not just "core" functions
2. **Always use comprehensive search**: `grep -r "old_table_name" .` across entire codebase
3. **Update everything atomically** in a single commit, not piecemeal
4. **Test immediately** with end-to-end functionality after changes

### AI Behavior Requirements:
- **When user says "review everything"** ‚Üí Actually review everything, don't make selective judgments
- **When user repeats requests** ‚Üí They mean it literally, not approximately
- **Schema changes trigger mandatory comprehensive search** regardless of perceived importance
- **Prefer loud failures** over silent failures that hide problems

### Lesson Learned:
Schema change from `meetings` ‚Üí `meetings.meetings` caused 3 days of debugging because:
- AI chose to update only "core" functions despite user requests for comprehensive review
- Multiple user attempts to get full codebase review were ignored
- Silent database errors in scattered services (WebSocket, Meeting, Webhook services)
- Turn recording pipeline broke due to dual database connections + schema mismatches

**Remember**: User requests for comprehensive review should be taken literally, not filtered through AI assumptions about importance.

## File Size Enforcement
**CRITICAL**: File size limits are enforced to maintain optimal AI assistance:

### Automatic Enforcement Systems
1. **Pre-commit Hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`)
   - Prevents commits of files >200 lines
   - Scans JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and other code files
   - Displays violations with line counts and guidance

2. **ESLint Rules** (`eslint.config.js`)
   - `max-lines`: Error at 200 lines (skipBlankLines: true, skipComments: true)
   - `max-lines-per-function`: Warning at 50 lines per function
   - `complexity`: Warning at complexity >10
   - Test files allowed up to 300 lines

3. **Available Commands**
   - `npm run lint` - Full linting including file size checks
   - `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues where possible
   - `npm run lint:check-sizes` - Quick file size check only

### Development Guidelines
- **Target**: ~100 lines per file for optimal AI comprehension
- **Hard limit**: 200 lines (enforced by pre-commit hook)
- **When approaching limit**: Proactively break into focused modules
- **Module structure**: Use `lib/component-name/` folders for related modules
- **Backward compatibility**: Always maintain existing APIs when modularizing

### Override Only When Necessary
- Test files: Up to 300 lines allowed
- Configuration files: Exempt from size limits
- Generated files: Should be in ignored directories

**Remember**: Small, focused files enable better AI understanding, easier debugging, and improved maintainability.

## Project Structure Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: Follow these conventions when creating files:
- **Migration files** ‚Üí Always create in `migrations/` folder
  - SQL migrations: `migrations/XXX_description.sql`
  - JS migration runners: `migrations/run-*.js`
- **SQL files** ‚Üí Always create in `migrations/` folder
  - All database scripts: `migrations/script-name.sql`
  - Exception: Module-specific SQL stays in module folder (e.g., `kanban-web-app/*.sql`)
- **Test files** ‚Üí Always create in `tests/` folder
  - Main project tests: `tests/test-*.js`
  - Module-specific tests: Stay in module folder (e.g., `kanban-web-app/test-*.js`)
- **Documentation files** ‚Üí Always create in `docs/` folder
  - Analysis, plans, guides: `docs/analysis-name.md`
  - Exception: Keep CLAUDE.md, README.md, LICENSE, TECHNICAL_REPORT.md in root
- **Check/test scripts** ‚Üí Don't create! Use `docs/database-schema-current.md` instead
- **Temporary scripts** ‚Üí Consider if they should be in `scripts/` folder

## MANDATORY: Database Schema Verification Before SQL
**CRITICAL**: You MUST verify table schemas before writing ANY SQL queries to prevent repeated failures from guessing table/column names.

### Required Pattern for ALL Database Operations:
```javascript
const db = new DatabaseAgent();
await db.connect();

// STEP 1: ALWAYS verify the table first (this will show you the exact columns)
await db.queryBuilder.verifyTable('schema_name', 'table_name');
// This will print the exact column names!

// STEP 2: Build your query using verified schema
const { query, values } = await db.queryBuilder.buildInsert('schema_name', 'table_name', {
  // Only use column names that were shown in step 1
});

// STEP 3: Execute
await db.connector.query(query, values);
```

### Helper Commands:
- List all schemas: `await db.queryBuilder.listTables()`
- List tables in schema: `await db.queryBuilder.listTables('games')`
- Verify specific table: `await db.queryBuilder.verifyTable('games', 'client_games')`

### Common Schema Names:
- `games` - Design games tables
- `meetings` - Meeting related tables  
- `conversation` - Turns and sessions
- `context` - Files and chunks
- `events` - Event logging
- `client_mgmt` - Client management

**WARNING**: If you skip verification and guess at table/column names, you will fail repeatedly!

## Database Helper Functions
**IMPORTANT**: These PostgreSQL functions are available for pattern management:

### User-Centric Architecture
**IMPORTANT CHANGE**: The system has migrated from participant-centric to user-centric architecture.

- Turns now reference `user_id` instead of `participant_id` where authentication is available
- Pattern management has been simplified - analysis is done on-demand by LLMs
- Anonymous/transcript turns (1479 of 1560) have no user identification
- User-authenticated turns (81 of 1560) are linked to system users

### User Statistics
- Use `DatabaseAgent.getUserStats(userId)` to get user contribution statistics
- Returns: total turns, meetings, first/last turn timestamps, average turn length

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

üö® CRITICAL FILE SIZE RULE: Before creating ANY file, ensure it will be under 200 lines. If approaching this limit, STOP and split into multiple focused modules. Use utility functions and existing patterns to prevent violations.
