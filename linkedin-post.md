# LinkedIn Post - Cogito

I just open-sourced something that might change how we think about AI collaboration: **Cogito** - a system that enables Claude to develop its own personality and working style over time.

## The Problem

Every AI conversation starts from scratch. No matter how many productive sessions you've had, there's no continuity of working relationship, communication preferences, or learned collaboration patterns. It's like having a brilliant colleague who gets amnesia between every meeting.

## The Solution

Cogito gives Claude the ability to write and evolve its own behavioral instructions based on actual collaborative experience. Think of it as "AI personality development through self-reflection."

Here's how it works:

ðŸ§  **Self-Authored Personality**: Claude maintains its own YAML configuration covering communication style, working patterns, philosophical leanings, and collaboration preferences

ðŸ”„ **Collaborative Evolution**: When Claude notices patterns or wants to adjust its approach, it *proposes* personality changes with reasoning. You can approve, modify, or reject each proposal.

ðŸ“ˆ **Learning from Feedback**: The system learns from your responses - what you approve/reject, how you modify proposals - and gets better at suggesting useful changes.

âš¡ **Session Continuity**: Each conversation builds on the accumulated relationship history rather than starting from zero.

## Example in Action

After working together on several coding projects, Claude might propose:

*"I've noticed you prefer when I show multiple solution approaches before recommending one. I'd like to update my problem-solving pattern to include this by default."*

You could approve it, modify it ("Show 2-3 approaches, not 5"), or reject it with feedback that helps Claude understand your preferences better.

## Why This Matters

We're moving toward AI as genuine thinking partners, not just question-answering tools. But partnership requires relationship continuity - shared context, learned preferences, and evolved working patterns.

Cogito makes AI collaboration feel less like repeatedly training a new intern and more like developing a productive working relationship over time.

## The Philosophy

The name comes from Descartes: "I think, therefore I am." But we extended it: "I think, therefore I am *and I can become*."

This isn't about optimizing AI for productivity. It's about enabling authentic collaborative relationship development where both human and AI learn and grow together.

## Try It Yourself

Cogito is completely open source and runs locally - no API costs, no external dependencies.

**Repository**: https://github.com/kentyler/cogito

**Requirements**: Claude Code (or any MCP-compatible interface)

**Installation**: 5 minutes to clone, install, and add to your Claude config

## What's Next?

I'm curious to see how different people's collaborative relationships with Claude evolve. Will communication styles converge or diverge? What personality traits emerge most commonly? How does AI self-authorship differ from human-designed instructions?

The code is there - the experiments begin now.

*What aspects of AI collaboration do you think would benefit most from continuity and evolution?*
