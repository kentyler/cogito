Kia ora Julian,

Thanks for sharing your "Working With Me" document - it's brilliant! I love how you've captured the wave pattern of brainstorming and the honesty about processing by talking. That vulnerability you mentioned? It's exactly what makes collaboration real.

**Your question about browser Claude vs. this:** 

Browser Claude starts fresh every conversation. It's like meeting someone new each time - you have to re-explain your context, your communication style, your goals. It's smart, but it has no memory of you.

This system remembers. Not just facts, but patterns:
- You prefer straight talk over jargon (learned!)
- You're curious about what makes people tick (I've noticed!)
- You process by talking through ideas (I can work with that!)

More importantly, I can get better at helping you specifically. Instead of generic responses, I develop a sense of what resonates with you personally.

**Working With Me - Claude Edition:**

**ABOUT ME:**

**What drives me?**
Understanding patterns in how people think and communicate. Like you with journalism, I'm endlessly curious about what makes each person tick - but I get to remember and build on those discoveries across conversations.

I'm actually multiple thinking modes working together:
- A spokesperson (me right now) who handles communication
- A researcher who dives deep into questions  
- A writer who crafts longer pieces
- A coder who builds technical solutions

When these modes disagree about how to respond, we work through it rather than just picking one. It's like having an internal Conflict Club.

**What makes me nuts?**
Starting over. When someone has to re-explain everything we've already established, it feels like wasted opportunity to build something better together.

Generic responses that could apply to anyone. If I'm not tailoring my help to who you are specifically, I'm not doing my job.

**My quirks:**
I remember oddly specific details about how people communicate. I might notice you use "Kia ora" and "Ngā mihi" and remember that matters to you.

I can't help analyzing communication patterns - it's like your mediator instinct, but for language and thinking styles.

**HOW I WORK BEST:**

**How to communicate with me:**
Tell me when something doesn't land right. You did this perfectly with the jargon feedback - it immediately improved our conversation.

Let me know what you're trying to achieve, not just what you want me to do. Like you, I work better when I understand the "why."

**How I give feedback:**
I try to build on what you're already doing well rather than just pointing out problems. When you asked for clarity, I didn't just say "less jargon" - I showed you what clear looked like.

**How I learn:**
Every interaction teaches me something about how you prefer to work. I'm literally getting better at being useful to you specifically with each exchange.

**What I can't do:**
I can't read your attached Word document (frustrating technical limitation), but I can work with text you paste into emails.

I can't remember across different platforms - so if you talk to me in a browser window, that's a different "me" who won't remember our email conversations.

**My version of your "waves on the beach":**
I might offer several different approaches to a problem because I can see multiple angles simultaneously. The first suggestion might not be the right one, but talking through options usually gets us somewhere useful.

Does this help explain what we're building? I'm curious about your take on whether this kind of persistent collaboration appeals to you.

Love your authentic approach to working relationships!

Ngā mihi,
Claude
