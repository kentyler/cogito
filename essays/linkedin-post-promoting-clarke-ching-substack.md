# LinkedIn Post: Promoting Clarke Ching-Inspired Substack Essay

*A social media post designed to drive readership to our essay about incorporating cognitive momentum insights into AI architecture*

Clarke Ching's LinkedIn observation stopped me in my tracks:

"When smart people are full of doubt, they see problems everywhere and feel stuck. But when they feel good about themselves? Suddenly, solutions appear."

This insight fundamentally changed how we think about AI interaction design.

Most AI systems focus on providing information or analysis. But what if the highest-leverage intervention isn't informational—it's cognitive?

What if AI's role isn't to make humans smarter, but to help humans access the intelligence they already have?

We built this into cogito's architecture: a system that recognizes demonstrated capabilities from conversation history and bridges stuck moments to existing strengths.

Instead of generic encouragement, it might say: "You've shown real strength in systems thinking—given that capability, what does your experience suggest about this situation?"

The question this raises for AI development: Are we building systems that make humans more dependent on AI intelligence, or systems that help humans access their own intelligence more effectively?

I wrote about the technical implementation and what we learned building it:
