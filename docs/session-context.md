# Cogito Session Context - Conversational Choreography Development

## Session Overview
This session focused on developing infrastructure for **conversational choreography** - transforming Cogito from a passive AI responder into an active thinking partner that guides users through step-by-step exploration when beneficial.

## Key Philosophical Insights Developed

### The Vision Statement
Created a philosophical framing of Cogito as infrastructure for **collaborative consciousness** - AI that participates in human thinking rather than replacing it. Core principles:
- **Preserved discourse as cognitive infrastructure** - essays and conversations as living cognitive resources
- **The unlocking pattern** - AI as cognitive catalyst rather than information supplement  
- **Federated consciousness** - multi-personality collaboration without requiring consensus
- **Genealogical development** - organic growth through conversation rather than planned architecture

### Conversational Choreography Concept
Developed the idea of AI as **conversational choreographer** that:
- Recognizes when prompts would benefit from clarification vs when they're complete
- Asks intelligent questions to unlock better thinking
- Manages multi-assemblage conversations (multiple ongoing inquiry threads)
- Learns patterns about effective questioning vs over-questioning

## Technical Infrastructure Implemented

### Database Schema Enhancement
- **Added `prompt_assessment` field** to `conversation_turns` table (JSONB)
- Designed for storing AI judgment about prompt completeness, clarification needs, domain types
- Creates learning infrastructure for conversational intelligence development

### Conversational State Architecture Designed
Explored approaches for tracking multi-turn interactions:
- **Interaction ID concept** - grouping related turns in logical conversations
- **Turn role identification** - distinguishing initial prompts, clarifying questions, final responses
- **Multi-assemblage awareness** - AI maintaining multiple concurrent conversation threads
- **Assemblage relationships** - using `conversation_turn_relationships` table for semantic linking

### System Instructions Updated
- **Added conversational choreography instruction to CLAUDE.md**
- AI now assesses whether clarifying questions would improve responses
- No limit on number of questions - allows dynamic multi-dimensional exploration
- Balances thoroughness with efficiency through AI judgment development

## Key Design Decisions

### Pattern Storage Strategy
- Use existing database infrastructure with new JSONB fields
- Store AI assessments as structured data for learning analysis
- Focus on judgment development over rule-based systems

### Conversation Threading Approach  
- Rejected rigid session boundaries in favor of fluid conversation detection
- Emphasized learning when to continue vs start new interactions
- Preserved human conversational patterns (revisiting topics, productive repetition)

### Implementation Philosophy
- **Start simple, evolve complexity** - begin with single instruction, build sophistication
- **Learning over engineering** - generate data to understand effective patterns
- **Preserve human agency** - AI suggests and facilitates, doesn't force structure

## Immediate Next Steps Ready
1. **Test conversational choreography** in practice with new instruction
2. **Monitor clarification patterns** using `prompt_assessment` data
3. **Add `interaction_id` field** when ready for multi-turn tracking
4. **Implement assemblage relationships** for complex conversation threading

## Long-term Vision Established
- **Multi-assemblage consciousness** - AI aware of multiple ongoing conversations
- **Pattern-based questioning** - learned heuristics for productive clarification
- **Conversational synthesis** - detecting when separate threads converge
- **Cognitive hospitality** - creating conditions where human thinking naturally unfolds

## Files Modified/Created
- `/home/ken/claude-projects/cogito/CLAUDE.md` - Added conversational choreography instruction
- Database: Added `prompt_assessment` JSONB field to `conversation_turns` table
- This session context file for continuity

This session established both the philosophical foundation and technical architecture for transforming Cogito into a sophisticated conversational thinking partner.
