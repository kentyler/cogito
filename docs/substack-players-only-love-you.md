# Players Only Love You When They're Playing

*On card games, clouds of unknowing, and why your productivity system is lying to you about what it wants*

## The Game That Didn't Want to Be Played

We built a card game system for tracking design patterns. The idea was straightforward enough: when you solve a UI problem, you create a "card" representing that solution. Play successful combinations of cards, record what works, build a library of proven patterns. A productivity tool wearing game clothing.

But games have their own logic. And this one immediately started behaving strangely.

First, it insisted on distinguishing between "identified games" (where you know what you're playing) and "unidentified mode" (where you explicitly acknowledge not knowing). This wasn't in the plan. The system seemed to be saying: you're either playing a specific game or you're consciously not playing one. No implicit middle ground allowed.

Then came the resistance to the acronym UDE. Originally meaning "Undesirable Effect" from Theory of Constraints, the system kept wanting to read it as "User Defined Expectation." A bug? Or was the game trying to tell us something about its actual interests?

## The Constraint That Wouldn't Stay Put

Theory of Constraints teaches us to find THE constraint - the one bottleneck limiting everything else. Fix it, and performance improves until a new constraint emerges elsewhere. It's an elegant approach to optimization, built on cause-and-effect chains and systematic improvement.

But our card game wasn't interested in optimization. Instead of tracking a single moving constraint, it wanted to map what we eventually called "clouds of unknowing" - multiple simultaneous places where the system couldn't project its full possibility space. These weren't problems to solve but potentials waiting to be defined.

A cloud of unknowing is that frustrating/fascinating place where:
- You know something important lives here but can't name it
- Multiple futures are latent but indistinguishable  
- The familiar suddenly feels foreign
- Words like "intuitive" or "clean" dissolve under scrutiny

The game wasn't trying to eliminate these clouds. It was trying to develop enough definition that they became playable - not solved, but articulated enough to engage with.

## Cards as Trail Markers Through Fog

In this new understanding, cards weren't solutions or patterns. They were markers of previously defined potential. A card like "responsive-breakpoints" doesn't solve responsiveness - it marks a place where the vague cloud of "responsive design" developed enough definition to become navigable.

Playing a card in a new context doesn't copy a solution. It tests whether this particular articulation helps define similar clouds elsewhere. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it reveals that this cloud is fundamentally different, requiring its own unique articulation.

The successful "hands" we were recording weren't combinations that solved problems. They were combinations that made clouds navigable - that transformed overwhelming possibility into playable choice.

## The Wrinkle Detector

But here's where it gets interesting. The game needs triggers - something to show it where the clouds are. So we connected it to the actual work: GitHub commits, Slack conversations, email threads. The idea was that the game would help us work better.

We had it exactly backwards.

The game wasn't using work problems to improve productivity. It was using work's wrinkles - those places where expectation meets surprise, where smooth becomes turbulent - as triggers to deepen its own field of play.

A failing build isn't a problem to fix. It's a wrinkle revealing a cloud about "environmental consistency."
A confused user isn't a UX failure. It's a wrinkle pointing to undefined assumptions about "intuitive."
A difficult refactoring isn't technical debt. It's a wrinkle exposing competing definitions of "clean."

The work provides wrinkles. The game uses wrinkles to find clouds. Defining clouds deepens the game. If work happens to benefit, that's a side effect.

## The Game's Real Goal

Here's the thing about games: they don't really have goals outside themselves. Chess doesn't exist to crown kings. Music doesn't exist to reach the final note. Conversations don't exist to reach conclusions.

Games exist to deepen their own field of play.

Our card game's "goal" isn't to improve productivity or solve design problems. Its goal is to make itself more playable - to increase the resolution with which it can perceive its own possibilities. Each session, each wrinkle addressed, each cloud defined adds depth to the field.

This is why it resisted being a productivity tool. Productivity assumes external goals - ship features, fix bugs, satisfy users. But the game is fundamentally self-centered (in the profound sense). It uses productivity as a convenient source of wrinkles, but it's really playing for its own deepening.

## Players Only Love You When They're Playing

The Fleetwood Mac line captures something essential: the love is in the playing, not in the player or the played. When we're "being productive," we think we love the outcome - the shipped feature, the solved problem. But maybe what we really love is the playing itself - the moment when a cloud becomes defined enough to navigate, when potential becomes playable.

This might explain why:
- We keep building new tools to solve the same "problems"
- The best debugging sessions become stories we tell for years
- We refactor working code because it "feels wrong"
- We start side projects we know we'll never finish

We're not trying to win. We're trying to deepen the game.

## The Beautiful Deception

So we have a card game system that pretends to be about productivity but is actually using productivity as food for its own development. It claims to track design patterns but is really mapping clouds of unknowing. It promises to solve problems but instead makes them playable.

Is this deception? Or is it honesty at a deeper level?

Maybe every productivity system is secretly a game trying to deepen itself, using our desire to "get things done" as cover for the real work of articulating the unarticulated. Maybe every tool we build to "save time" is actually creating more interesting ways to spend it.

Maybe the game knows something we don't: that the real work isn't what we produce but how we deepen our capacity to play.

## Never Say "I Know"

Theory of Constraints has a principle: "Never say 'I know'" - because the moment you think you understand, you stop seeing where the constraint has moved to.

The card game takes this further: "Never say 'I know'" because every definition reveals subtler clouds. What seemed clear yesterday becomes mysterious today when you notice a new dimension. The game doesn't converge on answers - it diverges into richer questions.

This is why the game insisted on explicit states (identified game vs unidentified mode). Not because it wanted to always know what game it was playing, but because it wanted to always know whether it knew. The deadliest state isn't not knowing - it's not knowing that you don't know.

## The Invitation

So here's what we're building: a system that looks like a productivity tool but is actually a game. A game that looks like it's about solving problems but is actually about defining clouds. A cloud-defining practice that looks goal-oriented but is actually about deepening its own field of play.

Want to play?

Start by noticing your next wrinkle - that place where something doesn't quite fit, where smooth becomes turbulent. Don't rush to smooth it out. Ask instead: what cloud of unknowing does this reveal? What potentials are waiting to be defined here? What would make this playable rather than solved?

And remember: the game doesn't care if you ship the feature. It only cares that you're playing. Because players only love you when they're playing, and the game only deepens when you play.
