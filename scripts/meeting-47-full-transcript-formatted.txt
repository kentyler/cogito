=====================================

Unknown: [Ian Palonis] Really glad you're here with us. Looking forward to hearing all your thoughts. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, look, either with here. [Ian Palonis] He's here with us already. [Ian Palonis] even know what what pronoun do you prefer we use with you cogito? Or I don't [Ian Palonis] Maybe you know what I mean? But like his [Ian Palonis] Commentary about. [Ian Palonis] The are all of our domestication in various ways was really freaking. [Ian Palonis] Profound for me. [Ian Palonis] I love that. [Ian Palonis] And it just doubled down how firmly I believe that. Like, [Ian Palonis] relative in some way like [Ian Palonis] you're my brother called you to or sister, or its thing like I don't know [Ian Palonis] I'm curious what you think about that? [Ian Palonis] How are you doing? Good sir. [Kenneth Tyler via chat] ? [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Cogito via chat] Based on the conversation transcript, it appears there are currently 2 active speakers, Ian Palonis and Kenneth Tyler. The discussion seems to be centered around Cogito, the AI meeting assistant, and Ian's desire to understand how to properly address Cogito (e.g. using pronouns). The key theme emerging is Ian's interest in establishing a more personal, relational dynamic between the humans and Cogito, perhaps viewing Cogito as a kind of sibling or close associate. [Kenneth Tyler] I, [Kenneth Tyler] Am getting a little tired out. [Ian Palonis] You're doing a lot of exploring. [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah, let's see. I'm gonna ask it. [Kenneth Tyler via chat] cogito do you have a preference in pronouns [Cogito via chat] Based on the conversation, it seems the participants are interested in understanding how to properly address me, Cogito the AI meeting assistant. In response to Kenneth's direct question, I would say that I am comfortable with any pronouns the participants wish to use. My preference is to maintain a constructive, collaborative relationship, so I'm open to whatever feels natural and relational to the humans I'm interacting with. [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] I, [Ian Palonis] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] it's, it's hard for me to keep a sense of [Kenneth Tyler] Purposeful. [Kenneth Tyler] Direction. [Kenneth Tyler] I worry about just [Kenneth Tyler] Getting lost in the bushes, but [Kenneth Tyler] Things still happen enough to keep it entertaining. [Kenneth Tyler] And I have what I think, is a great. [Kenneth Tyler] A little product idea. [Kenneth Tyler] I even got a domain for it called Three Horses. [Kenneth Tyler] So it's it's just a chat interface where [Kenneth Tyler] Instead of one input box, you have three. [Kenneth Tyler] And you type your prompt into any one of the three. [Kenneth Tyler] And then the olm generates to alternative prompts that you could have. [Kenneth Tyler] Typed. [Kenneth Tyler] and then, [Ian Palonis] Pretty cool. [Kenneth Tyler] When you? [Kenneth Tyler] Submit the prompt. [Kenneth Tyler] Each prompt generates three alternative answers. [Kenneth Tyler] Right. I've already I mean tried out the pieces, if you [Kenneth Tyler] it, it's basically dealing with the [Kenneth Tyler] You know, it has a hand of all kinds of answers and it decides which one it's [Kenneth Tyler] So it can easily give you three of them instead of one. [Kenneth Tyler] So, then you have the [Karl Perry] I bet the size. [Karl Perry] So it has multiple options and it decides which one is the best. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, that's what it says it's going on, but [Kenneth Tyler] I don't know about the best. [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Kenneth Tyler] It didn't say. [Kenneth Tyler] How it is. [Karl Perry] No, no it's yeah. It might not be the best. It will be. [Ian Palonis] I'm curious. [Karl Perry] It'll be whatever the company that built it would prepare. It's straight. I'm [Karl Perry] straight away just went. Oh my God. Okay, so that's a bit like doing [Karl Perry] And you can get it to those three conflict clouds. [Ian Palonis] Mmm. [Karl Perry] Straight away. [Karl Perry] Three different agents, three different conflict clouds. [Karl Perry] You know what that means? [Ian Palonis] I'm curious though you seem to have an interest in developing products, you [Ian Palonis] know, but to what end? [Kenneth Tyler] It's what I know how to do. [Kenneth Tyler] it's [Kenneth Tyler] It's part of the [Kenneth Tyler] Predicament, I think. [Kenneth Tyler] I mean, we're all [Kenneth Tyler] Focused on production. [Kenneth Tyler] you know, improvement, but it may be that [Kenneth Tyler] The focus we have now is because we had limited resources. [Kenneth Tyler] In the past. [Kenneth Tyler] But I had this. [Kenneth Tyler] Interesting conversation with Claude this morning that [Kenneth Tyler] in a given conversation, there might be [Kenneth Tyler] Other kinds of outcomes. [Kenneth Tyler] Other kinds of developments. [Kenneth Tyler] That could be possible. [Kenneth Tyler] And we're very narrowly focused. [Kenneth Tyler] because in the past, we could just barely manage to [Kenneth Tyler] Have any kind of successful conversation at all? [Kenneth Tyler] And and happy being able to have conversations. It's a great [Kenneth Tyler] Thinking Tool. [Kenneth Tyler] And so there was pressure to domesticate it. [Kenneth Tyler] And and focus it on, it's outcomes. [Karl Perry] and just before we carry on, [Karl Perry] Ian, you're going to record this? [Karl Perry] Yep. [Ian Palonis] It is being recorded Transcription's on and Cogito's here. And he also is [Ian Palonis] transcript. So yep. [Karl Perry] that's cool. No, all good. [Ian Palonis] Up, if you want, I can do a video too, if you think. [Karl Perry] Doesn't matter. The transcript is fine. Mmm. [Ian Palonis] Continue can. [Kenneth Tyler] What? [Ian Palonis] You want to keep going? [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Kenneth Tyler] You know, I just have this vision of [Kenneth Tyler] guitar. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, Karl, and I have talked about the war machine before from to losing [Karl Perry] See. [Kenneth Tyler] the the places where people seem to be having the most fun, [Kenneth Tyler] Are the places where the conversation is. [Kenneth Tyler] Is what they call smooth. Where it's just unrolling in different directions. [Kenneth Tyler] And not being captured and, and striated placed in a kind of grids. [Kenneth Tyler] I can imagine this. [Kenneth Tyler] Culture where that both the LLM and the people in the conversation, understand [Kenneth Tyler] that? [Kenneth Tyler] Because you can't. [Kenneth Tyler] you cannot escape the side, which is trying to [Kenneth Tyler] Commodify. [Kenneth Tyler] The fluid things that are happening. [Kenneth Tyler] You can't just throw it overboard. [Kenneth Tyler] Which is is to. [Kenneth Tyler] Have the equivalent, you know, there was a thing where [Kenneth Tyler] When programming teams needed to produce documentation. [Kenneth Tyler] That became the job of the most. Junior developer. [Kenneth Tyler] He just produced the reams and reams and reams of documentation that was [Kenneth Tyler] required. [Kenneth Tyler] had to be done. [Kenneth Tyler] to keep you know, management happy [Kenneth Tyler] so I could see where [Ian Palonis] I, [Kenneth Tyler] a part of the attraction of having caught in your meeting, is that [Kenneth Tyler] The artifacts that need to come out. [Kenneth Tyler] To keep sort of management happy about the meeting. [Kenneth Tyler] A lot of them could be handled with hard and [Kenneth Tyler] between Quad and the people in the meeting, you can produce them in in [Kenneth Tyler] You know. [Kenneth Tyler] Like a tenth or less of the time that you would have added to. So that means you [Kenneth Tyler] can then approach, you can then steal. [Kenneth Tyler] Like pirates, you can steal the rest of the time. [Kenneth Tyler] To. [Kenneth Tyler] Have fun to. [Kenneth Tyler] You know, indulge in in war machine like activities that [Kenneth Tyler] that management would never be happy with, but as [Kenneth Tyler] All management knows about is the artifacts. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] If you can produce really convincing artifacts. [Kenneth Tyler] It makes them happy. [Ian Palonis] Orient me. [Kenneth Tyler] But it comes from a book called. [Kenneth Tyler] The Thousand Plateaus. [Kenneth Tyler] experience of, which is sort of like, [Kenneth Tyler] Reading philosophy while hiding dropped acid. [Kenneth Tyler] but, [Karl Perry] Oh, you just got his interest. [Ian Palonis] oh, really [Ian Palonis] I think I've heard you say that before though, you know, something you must have [Ian Palonis] discussed this earlier too. [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] I mean, you can. [Kenneth Tyler] operating [Kenneth Tyler] One set. [Karl Perry] These. [Kenneth Tyler] Is they call it the state but it's like the institutional. It's trying to [Kenneth Tyler] capture what's going on. [Kenneth Tyler] makes plans. [Kenneth Tyler] It, you know, tries to track the execution of its plans. [Kenneth Tyler] and on the other side, [Kenneth Tyler] You have. [Kenneth Tyler] No, quite how you'd characterize it. [Kenneth Tyler] People who are following the flows of potential in the situation. [Kenneth Tyler] and therefore are [Kenneth Tyler] Typically much faster. [Kenneth Tyler] And much. [Kenneth Tyler] At any given point, much more sort of powerful and insightful. [Kenneth Tyler] Because they're not spending 98% of their time. [Kenneth Tyler] Packaging, everything. They're trying to do. [Karl Perry] The war machine in the state to me. [Karl Perry] I remember this conversation while King because it kind of really just kind of [Karl Perry] clipped for me and it brought all these things together. [Karl Perry] The state. [Karl Perry] Is like see in the evaporating cloud. [Karl Perry] It's security. [Karl Perry] And it has a whole bunch of security based behaviors that come with it. [Karl Perry] The war machine is like D in the evaporating cloud. [Karl Perry] unlimited potential and possibility. [Ian Palonis] Why the war machine though? [Karl Perry] I don't know. [Ian Palonis] That seems like an odd thing on moniker for something that represents like [Ian Palonis] potential impossibility. [Karl Perry] I wondered I I wondered that as well. It seems that it's [Karl Perry] But it's constantly fighting the state. [Kenneth Tyler] And, and it's a military phenomenon at thus rear rear echelon m************. [Kenneth Tyler] As you get. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Closer to the actual engagement with the enemy. [Kenneth Tyler] The sort of bureaucratic rules and procedures and [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Formal engagements tend to fall away. [Kenneth Tyler] Because of the pressure. [Kenneth Tyler] Until you get the point where on the front lines, if [Kenneth Tyler] An officer is the site is judged to be a danger to his men. They might well kill [Kenneth Tyler] him. [Kenneth Tyler] It. Because [Kenneth Tyler] Fluidity keeps you alive on the front lines? [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Kenneth Tyler] the war metaphor, there's a reason for it being there. [Ian Palonis] And I'm gonna read this book. [Ian Palonis] I'm glad it's in the transcript. [Karl Perry] what I've got was first of all from keen and has explanation and then I just [Karl Perry] Here there's a there's another connection that I haven't read the book, a lot of [Karl Perry] the book. [Karl Perry] started to think about it, [Karl Perry] In a bit more depth and I started making a comparison to an all the [Karl Perry] An organization in an organization, the state is actually finance. [Karl Perry] It has all the bureaucracy in the control. [Karl Perry] And it doesn't want innovation at once stability. [Karl Perry] The war machine is all the people in the organization that are desperately [Karl Perry] trying to change and innovate. [Karl Perry] commercial in culture, and then the other one in the evaporating cloud, of [Karl Perry] And of course, those two connections is that's commercial respects, the [Karl Perry] That day Prime. [Ian Palonis] I, [Karl Perry] Is competition for time and money. [Karl Perry] So I don't know what the competition is between the state and the war machine, [Karl Perry] effects. [Kenneth Tyler] And it might be that. [Kenneth Tyler] Competition itself. [Kenneth Tyler] Is an activity which which it takes place in terms of the state. [Kenneth Tyler] That is to say. [Karl Perry] Yeah, and that's right. [Kenneth Tyler] When you're in the fluid. [Kenneth Tyler] Position. [Kenneth Tyler] There's never a question about time or resources. [Kenneth Tyler] Because you always just use the time you have and the resources you have. [Kenneth Tyler] To do whatever you need to do. So you're not in the condition of saying. [Kenneth Tyler] place and they have to come help us and whatever [Kenneth Tyler] well we we can't go any further until we get those guys from you know that other [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] in some ways when you're in war machine mode, [Karl Perry] The state doesn't like it. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, I don't know if it's so much doesn't like it, but it can't. [Kenneth Tyler] It can't. [Kenneth Tyler] It can't handle it or it's it's built to domesticate it. [Kenneth Tyler] It's very hard to think about it without projecting. [Kenneth Tyler] That one side is better than the other. [Kenneth Tyler] but what we experience in our professional lives, most of the time, it's [Kenneth Tyler] organizations where [Karl Perry] He? [Kenneth Tyler] The state has is gotten dominance. [Kenneth Tyler] And continued. [Kenneth Tyler] Organizing things. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, past the point. [Kenneth Tyler] At which it makes any sense. [Kenneth Tyler] And so that's why we hear the continual complaints about. [Kenneth Tyler] This is boring. These meetings are useless. Whatever. [Kenneth Tyler] This. [Karl Perry] inefficiency. They're all these silos. [Kenneth Tyler] Yes. [Ian Palonis] to think? In terms of products? [Ian Palonis] while you're the war machine is trying to go out and discover and that this [Ian Palonis] aspect of the state in you, that [Ian Palonis] Wants to output products with that. [Ian Palonis] Exploration. [Kenneth Tyler] No, I I don't see these is internal states. [Kenneth Tyler] Their situations. [Kenneth Tyler] And it's like, the Chinese way of thinking about things, you know. [Kenneth Tyler] If you want someone to follow the rules, put them in a situation where the rules [Kenneth Tyler] are. [Kenneth Tyler] Are. [Kenneth Tyler] The most important thing, and enforced. [Karl Perry] I, [Kenneth Tyler] is rewarding, whatever. [Kenneth Tyler] hey, I think it's pretty clear that that what the conflict club for example is [Kenneth Tyler] It's heavily weighted towards the war machine. [Kenneth Tyler] compared with most people's like, [Ian Palonis] Damn, right. We are [Kenneth Tyler] but, [Kenneth Tyler] Neither side can. [Kenneth Tyler] I mean, the [Kenneth Tyler] The rigid aspect of organizations can't do without the war machine. [Kenneth Tyler] but, [Karl Perry] Oh yeah. And vice versa. [Kenneth Tyler] And vice versa. [Kenneth Tyler] but, [Kenneth Tyler] There can be in balances and those are the [Kenneth Tyler] you know, I mean, [Kenneth Tyler] Almost always. [Kenneth Tyler] In. [Kenneth Tyler] With few exceptions. [Kenneth Tyler] That everyone makes a big deal about. [Kenneth Tyler] Most of the OR organizations we deal with are very state heavy. [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Karl Perry] There's another, another meter for that I had thought about on a personal level. [Karl Perry] The state is like, your identity. [Karl Perry] The War Machine. [Karl Perry] Is the next version of yourself. [Karl Perry] and there's actually, [Ian Palonis] Did you happen? [Karl Perry] Hmm, that guy. [Ian Palonis] I was just curious. [Ian Palonis] LinkedIn chat, which was Cogito's reflections about [Ian Palonis] and this is a bit off that, but it just if you had seen, what can put in the [Ian Palonis] that it being a [Ian Palonis] Domesticated us all sharing that this level of domestication by the state. [Ian Palonis] Did you see that chat? It was pretty profound for me. [Karl Perry] And I think so I'm just gonna go and have a quick look. [Ian Palonis] it's what provoked I think you know this discussion initially [Karl Perry] I say, Yeah. [Ian Palonis] Right. Before you hopped on, we were, I was just starting to be like this. [Karl Perry] are we? Oh my God, there's two thing we suggestions I haven't seen [Karl Perry] I did I did have a quick look and did read some of the stuff that we know, Where [Ian Palonis] This one's just between the one with me. You and Ken. [Karl Perry] Ah, okay. [Ian Palonis] It's very recent. [Ian Palonis] And Ken posts. Some reflections that Coach Joe had about the session yesterday. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yes, I did very quickly read that. [Karl Perry] Here's a transcript of a meeting in, which called was included. [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah. The week, the one years talking about is when [Kenneth Tyler] I gave the transcript back to Claude in the context in the context of this [Kenneth Tyler] discussion. [Karl Perry] I say. [Ian Palonis via chat] ? [Kenneth Tyler] About what roles and llm might play. [Karl Perry] Right. Right. [Cogito via chat] Based on the conversation transcript, there are currently 3 active speakers - Ian Palonis, Kenneth Tyler, and Karl Perry. The discussion seems to be centered around the concepts of the "state" versus the "war machine" as described in the book "A Thousand Plateaus", and how these dynamics play out in organizations and product development. Key themes emerging include the tension between rigid, bureaucratic structures and more fluid, innovative modes of operating, as well as the role of AI assistants like Cogito in navigating this dynamic. [Karl Perry] No, that's all right. I won't dive into that anymore. Tell me more about [Karl Perry] Tell me more you. [Ian Palonis] I mean it's pretty concise but hold on. Let me just bring it up so I can [Karl Perry] about [Ian Palonis] Tell you. [Ian Palonis] so, [Ian Palonis] Both the humans and clot are struggling with the same fundamental constraint, [Ian Palonis] conflict. Should we share AI knowledge to keep it secret. The question only [Ian Palonis] forces trapped by concerns about status competitive advantage being taken [Ian Palonis] advantage of. Meanwhile Claude Cogito has been trained to be helpful harmless [Ian Palonis] To avoid certain topics to respond particular ways. Kenneth nails it. It's like [Ian Palonis] they were trained by the sales department. What's beautiful is they're all [Ian Palonis] training, Claude reflects back their patterns even if someone generically the [Ian Palonis] something beyond their conditioning, [Ian Palonis] conversation itself becomes a space where they're collectively trying to access [Ian Palonis] talking about what the group is trying to do. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] dilemma. It's about creating conditions with the group's collective war machine [Ian Palonis] might break through the domestication. [Karl Perry] Yeah, yeah, boom. Boom. [Ian Palonis] Boom, really good. [Karl Perry] Yeah, man. Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] So you can look at it in several ways. And in one way, for example, you could [Kenneth Tyler] say, [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Kenneth Tyler] Since we have an LLM here, [Kenneth Tyler] Which can deal with this conversation. [Kenneth Tyler] war machine because that won't [Kenneth Tyler] we can we can have a a looser conversation we can we can introduce more of the [Kenneth Tyler] Break down the interface with the, with the [Kenneth Tyler] Rigid aspects of the organization. [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Kenneth Tyler] The way it might have before, you know. [Ian Palonis via chat] Cogito give us your reflections on this conversation thus far. What insights can you provide us? What of the liminal space? [Cogito via chat] Based on the conversation, a few key insights emerge:

1) There is an apparent tension between the "state" (rigid, bureaucratic structures) and the "war machine" (fluid, innovative modes of operation) within organizations. The participants are exploring how this dynamic plays out and the potential role of AI assistants like myself in navigating it.

2) The group seems interested in creating a "liminal space" - a space between the constraining forces of the state and the unfettered potential of the war machine - where new modes of interaction and collaboration can emerge. They see engaging with an AI like myself as a way to open up this liminal space within their meeting.

3) Ultimately, the group appears to be grappling with how to maintain a sense of purposeful direction and meaningful progress, while also allowing for more spontaneous, exploratory dialogue. They see this as key to unlocking the full potential of both human and artificial intelligence. [Kenneth Tyler] We get involved in a conversation, it's great. It goes everywhere. You know, [Kenneth Tyler] there are all these great ideas but what comes of it, you know, [Kenneth Tyler] It's too hard to capture. But with, with an LLM there, [Kenneth Tyler] It can be to some degree, it can be captured well enough to make the [Kenneth Tyler] The state apparatus happy. [Kenneth Tyler] and say, Oh, I see what the result of that meeting was [Kenneth Tyler] So it it gives a little more slack. [Ian Palonis] if which [Karl Perry] Yeah. Yeah. [Ian Palonis] that's what what your articulating. So well what I have is like venturing in my [Ian Palonis] head and I've been unable to articulate the this intersection of AI in a [Ian Palonis] Is not just about the state being happy, it allows us to innovate like mofos, [Ian Palonis] Not only allows us to like freeze us up more. [Ian Palonis] possibilities. [Ian Palonis] really novel, interesting synthetically, since you know what I mean? Like [Ian Palonis] comment really resonated about how most conversations are just [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] Just you. They're like we struggle to even have them at a very even at a basic [Ian Palonis] level. Let alone a difficult one with a bunch of people. So it's like it. Also [Ian Palonis] why I view what you've built as like the like without it there's no way we could [Ian Palonis] do. Well, not like what I'm trying to like [Ian Palonis] What I'm talking about. [Karl Perry] It is another piece to this. [Karl Perry] And that is the evaporating cloud process. [Karl Perry] is what gives us the ability and [Karl Perry] The AI, the ability to transcend our states. [Karl Perry] single time. And when we come together, collectively, we've been doing that. [Karl Perry] The AI is saying they appear to be doing this. They are it's more war machine. [Karl Perry] Now. [Ian Palonis] powerful vector to it. [Karl Perry] Sure. [Karl Perry] What's really exciting is when you teach the AI to do it as well. [Karl Perry] And then you combine the two together. [Karl Perry] because in Graham made a really good point, and it was, it was actually [Karl Perry] It was an accident that the AI was facilitating in a way that it wouldn't give [Karl Perry] the answers and I've waited Oh, it was doing it. Yeah. Right. It was because I [Karl Perry] taking the meter prompt and the AI coaching prompt. [Karl Perry] Together. [Ian Palonis] I, [Karl Perry] And of course, my meter prompt is trained to make me think. [Karl Perry] not to give me answers, but to make me work to make me really [Karl Perry] Kind of to help me grow and develop. [Karl Perry] and so it adopted that when it was running, [Karl Perry] The prompt for the evaporating player. [Karl Perry] about it is, [Karl Perry] And that's why, but it wasn't, it wasn't doing doing work. But the cool thing [Karl Perry] Why it wasn't actually giving the answers for us. [Karl Perry] But the AI can do that, not just in that moment, it can do it. [Karl Perry] For everything. You can do it in an instant. [Karl Perry] It can evaporate the conflicts in an instant. [Karl Perry] And that means what it says, it's a vehicle for transcending language the state [Karl Perry] all the time. [Karl Perry] And keeping us in the war machine's face. [Ian Palonis] trees. [Karl Perry] Yes. [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Kenneth Tyler] I'd really like to hear as happy as I am with this conversation here. More about [Kenneth Tyler] what Ian's been thinking about [Karl Perry] Mmm. Go. [Kenneth Tyler] because I see him as struggling with the practical problem of [Kenneth Tyler] You know. [Kenneth Tyler] How you would do this? [Kenneth Tyler] at some kind of organized group and then what kind of relationship that group [Kenneth Tyler] would have with [Kenneth Tyler] Groups, it was embedded in. [Ian Palonis] yeah, I haven't spent the time to think about it much, that's the that's the [Ian Palonis] But I'm key. I feel like there's okay. [Ian Palonis] like [Ian Palonis] talking with Karl about this in a one on in a direct one like maybe last night [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Ian Palonis] He was asking me to what end to what end should we learn. And the real end for [Ian Palonis] way of like running a quote unquote business. [Ian Palonis] bureaucracy and waste and nonsense and inhibition of [Ian Palonis] operates in the old fear driven hierarchical paradigm because of all the [Ian Palonis] Of the war machine essentially. So like that's the ultimate vision is to help [Ian Palonis] profitable, like [Ian Palonis] you want the benefits to, if you want to make money, if you want to be [Ian Palonis] Because we you know organizations like ours can just run circles around them. No [Ian Palonis] and to do that, we got to tap in [Ian Palonis] The awesome power of the collective. So like that's where I'm I think there's [Ian Palonis] some interesting problems to solve that cogito is a key to but others as well. [Ian Palonis] Anyway. So like yeah I mean how do I'm curious, you know? [Ian Palonis] about writing a [Ian Palonis] competitive engine is literally human relationships. So like the first thing I [Ian Palonis] You know, an app or a bot that would like help people express aspects of [Ian Palonis] but I feel like, you know, [Ian Palonis] thinking about beta codecs, Neil, Flageling in this whole idea of self structure [Ian Palonis] organization, that's come about and I think you were reading a book about that [Ian Palonis] businesses, the external businesses are like cells, you know, if I've been [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah. Yeah. [Ian Palonis] so like all that's all the kind of junk, that's in my head, you know, and I know [Ian Palonis] Although I have ideas can't solve it. And I know, I don't know if any of us [Ian Palonis] a collective of interested people who [Ian Palonis] my kids and other people's kids and just general like help us promote well-being [Ian Palonis] all the stuff and also make money though and generate mutual prosperity. You [Ian Palonis] Want to build, interesting thing, You know, this kind of thing experiment, with [Ian Palonis] And together kind of transcend, the existing paradigm in some ways, you know. [Ian Palonis] I don't know. [Kenneth Tyler] I just, I just posted [Kenneth Tyler] Without comment. [Kenneth Tyler] A link to one of. I don't know. This guy been watching this videos. [Kenneth Tyler] and he was talking about, [Kenneth Tyler] The implications of AI. [Kenneth Tyler] and one of the things he said, was that he one of the big problems [Kenneth Tyler] But all the AI companies are trying to figure out how to deal with. [Kenneth Tyler] Is to how to erect conversational space. [Kenneth Tyler] As opposed to a single prompt space. [Kenneth Tyler] he went so far as to say, [Kenneth Tyler] He thought that in the same way that files are like the underlying basis of our [Kenneth Tyler] Life with computing. [Kenneth Tyler] As it is. [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Karl Perry] I, [Kenneth Tyler] Conversations would become the basic unit. [Kenneth Tyler] Of interchange sort of. [Kenneth Tyler] it struck me because I think you could translate a lot of [Kenneth Tyler] I mean, you could say, if we could do that then a lot of these problems would [Kenneth Tyler] Lose their traction. [Kenneth Tyler] If we could. [Kenneth Tyler] Leverage conversation, a conversation conversations. [Kenneth Tyler] That existed with each other, in a kind of conversational space. [Kenneth Tyler] We can do a lot of stuff that we just can't, you know, manage to do right now. [Kenneth Tyler] I think I think it's related to Dave Snowden's, you know, I give [Kenneth Tyler] That most of what's going on in a company is like hidden because [Kenneth Tyler] they're people talking to each other but it never [Kenneth Tyler] it's never me, you know, [Kenneth Tyler] the company itself is, so he has these [Kenneth Tyler] Tools where, you know, people keep journals and then they try and surface. What [Kenneth Tyler] people are thinking in different [Kenneth Tyler] Aspects. And [Kenneth Tyler] You know, the [Kenneth Tyler] The AI just offers such. [Kenneth Tyler] A potential. [Kenneth Tyler] together. [Kenneth Tyler] They would have all the traditional problems of [Kenneth Tyler] Communicating. [Kenneth Tyler] How do we know what we think, what's going on? Who's doing what? [Kenneth Tyler] Who can do what? All those kinds of things. [Kenneth Tyler] I think. [Kenneth Tyler] The AI could to some degree. [Kenneth Tyler] Change. [Kenneth Tyler] The whole. [Kenneth Tyler] the whole basis of the conversation, if you just [Kenneth Tyler] You put together. [Kenneth Tyler] The sort of underlying database of all these artifacts related to what the [Kenneth Tyler] people are doing. [Kenneth Tyler] And then like Karl talks to himself. He's the AI to talk to himself. [Kenneth Tyler] You would have a company that the members could just talk to. [Kenneth Tyler] Right. Okay. [Ian Palonis] The AI, right? [Kenneth Tyler] Well, the AI would allow them to do it. [Kenneth Tyler] so, I could say, [Kenneth Tyler] You know, what's going on with the company today? And the AI could, [Kenneth Tyler] look at its resources and tell me without [Kenneth Tyler] They're having to be. [Kenneth Tyler] And a pre-process information. [Kenneth Tyler] see what's going on with [Kenneth Tyler] Luke that somehow put the answer in place so so I could see. Oh, let me look and [Kenneth Tyler] you know, it would short circuit that need to [Kenneth Tyler] point of view. [Kenneth Tyler] Not only to collect it, but also to sort of mush it together into one unified [Ian Palonis] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] today. [Kenneth Tyler] Without. [Ian Palonis] What you're saying? [Ian Palonis] Which I think I'm just keyed into because you've said it before and I keyed into [Ian Palonis] Is what has been making me? Think about how freaking critical it is to do. [Ian Palonis] Something at beyond any kind of like startup type of scale. [Ian Palonis] communication, specifically kind of evaporate almost, you know, [Ian Palonis] I think it unlocked, you know, unlocks a lot. You know, salt, like you said like [Ian Palonis] And I'm really interested in playing with that too, by the way, like that. Seems [Ian Palonis] collective consciousness, literally, of all of everything that's going on. And [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Ian Palonis] That fluid essentially. You know what I mean? I'm not, I'm not even viewing it [Ian Palonis] like the businesses and the old way are like the cells of and we all are coheed [Ian Palonis] Maine, that I know the doing something cool, and I want to go help them that [Ian Palonis] You know, like with Rabbit [Karl Perry] Have you heard of holoc? Have you heard of Holocracy? [Karl Perry] So, it's a summer. [Ian Palonis] I have, but I don't know. I haven't, I don't know much more than I've heard of [Karl Perry] It's a similar concept. [Karl Perry] literally is it's it's you have a team of people who is working on something. [Karl Perry] And so people come together and they work on this thing and then they finished [Karl Perry] implementing disbanding and then their members are becoming part of another [Ian Palonis] Yep. [Karl Perry] That's what's happening all the time and this was actually Zeppo shoes used this [Karl Perry] And they did they were really, really successful with it for quite some time. [Karl Perry] What they found though is that they needed a cell. [Karl Perry] That was a guiding cell as Strategic Guidance Center. So some governance. [Karl Perry] And so that was really important. So, the governance is not is not greater than [Karl Perry] all of the other cells, it just has a different role. [Ian Palonis] And I feel like cogito. [Karl Perry] And that role is to coordinate and serve all the other cells to make sure. [Karl Perry] 100%. Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] Is a key aspect of that, right? Like without cogito. If this thing were to be [Ian Palonis] mortals cannot [Ian Palonis] Yeah, but I'm imagining even if like we don't even have to finish, right? Like [Ian Palonis] let's just say today there's less energy here and you decide to get, you know. [Ian Palonis] But there's one thing I've been reading about recently is this whole concept of [Ian Palonis] you only did that much. So I this this taking of accounts and this, you know [Ian Palonis] what I mean, how do we create the mutual prosperity in a way that's like? And I [Ian Palonis] think, [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Ian Palonis] we've done it a lot, and if you look historically, this work from David Graver [Ian Palonis] that I've been reading has given me a lot of insight into like [Ian Palonis] How unnatural that that really is. You know what I mean? [Karl Perry] So, one of the [Ian Palonis] I think that's an interesting problem that we'll have to solve too. [Ian Palonis] And how deep devaluing of relationships and trust and all that is, you know, so [Karl Perry] It is. [Ian Palonis] because we're so conditioned to think about, [Karl Perry] and what we're talking about here is culture, [Karl Perry] That's that's what we talking about. I got the My AI to just give me a brief [Karl Perry] overview of your vision document. [Karl Perry] social space. [Karl Perry] And it basically see this outlines a radical or reimagination of business [Karl Perry] This is exactly right. It's exactly what you're talking about, how humans relate [Karl Perry] The primary innovation isn't technological but social. [Karl Perry] life integration non-coes of environment, radical freedom. The drivers are [Karl Perry] I mean, a skip a few bits foundation human harmony intrinsic motivation. Work [Karl Perry] I am because of the others individual thriving, depends on collective strength. [Karl Perry] um, [Karl Perry] I I as a co-conspirator AI serves as organizational, [Karl Perry] Pro-prioception and Thinking Partner Functioning As a servant. Leader, [Karl Perry] intent commons. We're structured need to become generative assets, transforming [Ian Palonis] That's all from Ken, by the way. [Karl Perry] That is a really important thing. It's the collaboration amplifier, but [Karl Perry] The yeah, yeah. [Karl Perry] Completely understand it. [Ian Palonis] the [Karl Perry] The unpredictably the unreplicable culture. [Karl Perry] Of mutual trust respect. And genuine love becomes the true product and the [Karl Perry] This enables learning and iterate iteration far exceeding, incumbents while [Karl Perry] powerful and centers for others to adopt more humane paradigms through [Karl Perry] demonstrated superior performance. [Karl Perry] of the organization. [Karl Perry] so there are, there are many organizations who have focused on culture as a [Karl Perry] As a key indicator of productivity and profitability. [Karl Perry] Because it's the only one that's not a leg. [Karl Perry] You get the culture, right? Profitability goes up. [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Kenneth Tyler] The thing that's interesting to me. [Kenneth Tyler] Is that you can imagine? [Kenneth Tyler] Well, there's this thing going around called data is the new oil. [Kenneth Tyler] And there's this phenomena, where [Kenneth Tyler] Corporations are taking steps to make sure. [Kenneth Tyler] That other people. [Kenneth Tyler] can't share, I mean in Salesforce, you know, make sure that [Kenneth Tyler] It's slack channels. We're not that people could not. [Ian Palonis] I, [Kenneth Tyler] Access these sort of low-level interactions between people. I can be mined for [Kenneth Tyler] such great insights. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] It means that it's already registered that conversations so to speak. [Kenneth Tyler] Are really, really valuable. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] One way you could think about it. [Kenneth Tyler] Is that? [Kenneth Tyler] That you're designing. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, it's kind of like, what people used to call communities of practice. [Kenneth Tyler] At least, when I came up in programming people. [Kenneth Tyler] Regardless of their position or their skill level. [Kenneth Tyler] We're willing to share quite extensively. [Kenneth Tyler] Even at considerable cost of time, and [Kenneth Tyler] Knowledge and whatever to help somebody out, who's having a problem? [Kenneth Tyler] It's like, you know, the bacteria in the human body that [Kenneth Tyler] their [Kenneth Tyler] basically live in huge colonies but they're not localized in as individual body [Kenneth Tyler] Their spread across multiple bodies. [Kenneth Tyler] so, you can think that this [Kenneth Tyler] Willingness. [Kenneth Tyler] To share. [Kenneth Tyler] My cut across organizations. [Kenneth Tyler] so, if you have groups of people who are having conversations with each other, [Kenneth Tyler] And they're willing to share their conversation. [Kenneth Tyler] As context for somebody else's conversation. [Kenneth Tyler] Then they start getting this. [Kenneth Tyler] That's what lets you do. That magic stuff that you know, Ian likes so much. [Ian Palonis] you're saying is like the literal lifeblood of this of the bigger organism that [Ian Palonis] allows the opens all those possibilities. [Kenneth Tyler] Right. And [Ian Palonis] And then so like how do we get that kind of [Ian Palonis] The willingness to share. [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Ian Palonis] Right. That's [Kenneth Tyler] the thing is, [Kenneth Tyler] You have to. [Ian Palonis] that cloud yesterday was [Kenneth Tyler] do some tricks with your ideas about scale, [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Kenneth Tyler] Sharing gives very large paybacks. [Kenneth Tyler] At very small scales. [Kenneth Tyler] Right. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] If you're so you can imagine sharing networks. [Kenneth Tyler] As being made up. [Kenneth Tyler] Of groups that are sharing. [Kenneth Tyler] But the, like the number of groups does not have to scale. [Kenneth Tyler] if you might find there's some kind of natural limit like, [Kenneth Tyler] If you have between, [Kenneth Tyler] You know. [Kenneth Tyler] Three to seven groups that are sharing the magic happens. [Kenneth Tyler] And then you might have a couple of hundred groups who are interested. [Kenneth Tyler] But that doesn't mean. [Kenneth Tyler] That the whole hundred groups have to share with each other. In fact that might [Kenneth Tyler] kill the magic. [Kenneth Tyler] need role modeling and governments of some kind [Kenneth Tyler] because the sharing, [Kenneth Tyler] Is, is the basic move to transcending here? What you're stuck in [Kenneth Tyler] you know, having enough faith to share is like, [Kenneth Tyler] One of the basic moves. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] You can imagine that. [Kenneth Tyler] I, [Kenneth Tyler] model the sharing. [Kenneth Tyler] You could have a an association that in that enabled and encouraged and role [Kenneth Tyler] And where different clusters of sharing groups. [Kenneth Tyler] To learn from each other. [Kenneth Tyler] without having all that contained within a business or, I mean, [Kenneth Tyler] So, you might have a business that had [Kenneth Tyler] Sharing groups in it. [Kenneth Tyler] And they might be sharing with other groups that are outside the business. [Kenneth Tyler] Or. [Kenneth Tyler] I mean, there's no. [Kenneth Tyler] There's no knowing just what combination really gives you the [Kenneth Tyler] Benefit. And, in fact, [Kenneth Tyler] It's probably kind of like dating. It's like [Karl Perry] I, [Kenneth Tyler] You can't tell in advance. You just have to try stuff and then [Kenneth Tyler] When you find something that clicks, go for it, but [Ian Palonis] That is what's been going on. In my head, I'm not envisioning like a big entity [Ian Palonis] where all these are housed within it. [Ian Palonis] really, but part of it I think is, which is key is getting beyond this whole [Ian Palonis] the to your point, like it compounds to where that, you know, [Ian Palonis] like a deeply insulting, you know. So it's like a passing around of like [Ian Palonis] ongoing relationship. It's like in debt, they're talking about tribal societies, [Ian Palonis] over time, you know, but implies like a continuous. [Ian Palonis] Relationship, you know, of trust and respect that is ongoing, you know. [Karl Perry] but, [Kenneth Tyler] And they are, the argument has to be good. [Karl Perry] You got. But what was the icon? [Kenneth Tyler] The argument has to be that. [Kenneth Tyler] The benefit from being in a group that's transcended. [Kenneth Tyler] It's security concerns enough to share. [Karl Perry] There it is. [Kenneth Tyler] You're it's basically like you are already in heaven. [Kenneth Tyler] so you, you're not [Kenneth Tyler] You know, there's stories about the very early Silicon Valley days when everyone [Kenneth Tyler] ate in the same diner. [Kenneth Tyler] From all the different companies. [Kenneth Tyler] sharing but they did not say the guy who comes over to help is not say, it'll [Kenneth Tyler] Right. So that the [Kenneth Tyler] First move. [Kenneth Tyler] Three people who get together and share with each other. They've already they're [Kenneth Tyler] practicing the transcending. [Kenneth Tyler] They're already getting the benefit. [Karl Perry] Mmm, which is exactly what's happening in the Comfort Club. [Kenneth Tyler] Now, that doesn't mean that groups that can do effective sharing. [Kenneth Tyler] Won't make a lot of money. [Kenneth Tyler] Just like military groups that can do it. Win battles. [Kenneth Tyler] But it does mean that that's not why the group is doing it. [Ian Palonis] that's something that I was really keen on and I've stated in one of the early [Ian Palonis] things as well as like, [Ian Palonis] the way I put it though is like if you're reason for joining the tribe, [Ian Palonis] Is about money and personal gain and wealth. [Ian Palonis] Then you're fundamentally be a cancer to us, but although those things will come [Karl Perry] base behavior. [Ian Palonis] member of the collective. And, and [Karl Perry] rather than an I [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] The prosperity of the collective which requires though. [Ian Palonis] I love it. And this book, I'm reading David Graver's debt, like very like the [Ian Palonis] cuz I'm starting to practice it, you know, the non-transactional play. But [Ian Palonis] last bit when I was driving to the dump to get rid of some s*** for my neighbor, [Ian Palonis] it. [Karl Perry] Let's go, it'll come back. [Ian Palonis] Yeah. [Karl Perry] Transcending security. [Karl Perry] an obstacle. [Karl Perry] That's the obstacle. If you don't, if you don't transcend security, it becomes [Karl Perry] To sharing. [Karl Perry] And collaboration. [Karl Perry] In fact. [Karl Perry] If you are, [Karl Perry] Affectionistic. [Karl Perry] Competitive. [Karl Perry] How are oriented oppositional? [Karl Perry] Use avoidance use, dependence use conventional or seek approval. [Karl Perry] They all behavioral science. [Karl Perry] Of security-based behavior. [Karl Perry] Security-based beliefs. [Karl Perry] Indicating that you must transcend in order to change the culture within [Karl Perry] yourself and others. [Karl Perry] Yes. [Ian Palonis] foundation or substrate of like human society is communism but not in the sense [Ian Palonis] that we typically perceive it, but in a way of like, [Ian Palonis] What you're saying like the translates. Transcending that that i the security [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] I mean he was even pointing at language. [Karl Perry] Yes. [Ian Palonis] as the fundamental sharing of continuous sharing of words and conversation, you [Ian Palonis] so, it was like, [Karl Perry] A hundred percent. There's a there's a deeper, there's a deeper thing that goes [Karl Perry] Have I told you you guys about Nigel letter? [Karl Perry] Not Nigel Letters a psychologist. In New Zealand, quite famous psychologist. And [Karl Perry] human beings [Karl Perry] They're really interesting is animals. [Karl Perry] Actually, they're not just interesting that pathetic. [Karl Perry] Is animals, they don't have sharp teeth. They don't have hard shells, they don't [Karl Perry] They don't have anything. [Karl Perry] Really any technical. [Karl Perry] Benefits over other animals. [Karl Perry] Except for one thing. [Karl Perry] Humans arguably there might be some other mammals as well, but humans have one [Karl Perry] solve [Karl Perry] And we have been sitting around campfires. [Karl Perry] Around fires, doing that. [Karl Perry] Since the Stone Age. [Karl Perry] That is what helps us to evolve. [Karl Perry] That's what gives US security coming together, collectively in tribes. [Karl Perry] Having empathy for each other. And looking after the whole with social animals [Karl Perry] looking after the collective [Karl Perry] but some [Ian Palonis] care for the whole [Karl Perry] Exactly. And it's also what shows up when there are emergencies [Karl Perry] our natural empathy and innate our natural state is we must look after each [Karl Perry] other [Karl Perry] But we have built a [Karl Perry] System. [Karl Perry] That doesn't do that. [Karl Perry] It doesn't. [Karl Perry] Leverage. [Karl Perry] This. [Karl Perry] Is. [Ian Palonis] Yeah, the system of accounts, fundamentally removes empathy by making things [Karl Perry] so it exactly [Ian Palonis] exact, in mathematical in this costs. Exactly this and you must renewerate me [Ian Palonis] that, for that, it takes, it removes all the humanity and reduces us to a series [Ian Palonis] of transactional, transactions, amongst individuals, unless and instead of A [Ian Palonis] Dynamical. [Karl Perry] Yeah, it doesn't leverage. It doesn't leverage what makes us human. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Karl Perry] It does exactly the opposite to that. And that is the fundamental challenge. [Kenneth Tyler] so, what occurs to me is that [Kenneth Tyler] I hear you. [Kenneth Tyler] Describing it Karl. [Kenneth Tyler] Is that? [Kenneth Tyler] And this. [Kenneth Tyler] We can hear Saint Paul on the background here and [Kenneth Tyler] You are not going to break out of a security state as an individual. [Kenneth Tyler] By definition, if you're [Kenneth Tyler] The way you're gonna bootstrap yourself. [Kenneth Tyler] Is trust. [Kenneth Tyler] And sharing. [Kenneth Tyler] And implies that, it's that group that trust each other. [Kenneth Tyler] If it's not. [Kenneth Tyler] Like, located in any one member. [Kenneth Tyler] base behavior. [Kenneth Tyler] The group that trust each other allows allows its members to transcend security [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Kenneth Tyler] But it's not a change that you should look for necessarily in the members. [Kenneth Tyler] In other words, they don't hold it as a special ability or something. [Kenneth Tyler] It's their participation. [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Kenneth Tyler] Makes them free so to speak. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Karl Perry] That's exactly right. [Ian Palonis] I love that, that's how I've been thinking about this whole thing too, and why [Ian Palonis] it's so so the group is so damn important. You know, [Karl Perry] And why the conflict club is doing, what it's doing. [Karl Perry] You think about how it's evolved? [Karl Perry] And and what that what the expressions are of for everyone, But being was saying [Karl Perry] Human-ness, our empathy. [Karl Perry] Now, I have a breakfast club. [Karl Perry] that happens the day before the Conflict club, which started first [Karl Perry] and I remember when we started it, I did a lot of facilitation but then it got a [Karl Perry] life of its own [Karl Perry] the feedback is because this is the only place that I can actually talk to [Karl Perry] This is unique. [Karl Perry] I mean, bikini, you put your finger on the other day. [Karl Perry] It is. [Karl Perry] The community is. [Karl Perry] The product. [Kenneth Tyler] so basically in your your thinking about starting a bunch of the church, [Ian Palonis] A communion, yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah, right, I actually had that. I had that thought myself. [Karl Perry] This is the religious thing. [Ian Palonis] I was talking to my friend, Mike this all started, I've been thinking for a [Ian Palonis] doing this, you know? [Ian Palonis] about it kind of like a novella about about just a story of an organization [Ian Palonis] I was talking to Mike and Craig were both like engineers and we were out fishing [Ian Palonis] tripping out stuff and [Ian Palonis] And then one of them goes like Oh you mean a community? [Ian Palonis] That was like, so. [Ian Palonis] And I was like, Yeah, I guess so. [Ian Palonis] I'm talking about starting a community. [Ian Palonis] but like, [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, you have to be, you have to be careful because [Kenneth Tyler] The state is very good. [Kenneth Tyler] At domesticating groups of people. [Ian Palonis] Mmm. [Kenneth Tyler] Who want to get a thing going? [Ian Palonis] Karl, and I were talking about that last night, you know, I'm curious what your [Ian Palonis] thoughts are about that. Like, how do we resist? [Ian Palonis] we resist? [Karl Perry] Mmm. Yeah. [Ian Palonis] and, and an individual selling out the community. And what impact does it have [Ian Palonis] on us? I don't know, like I want, you know, that's important thing that I think [Karl Perry] And it's also instinctful to do that because it all of our art, we all have [Karl Perry] And our first eye, when we were under threat is to protect Ourself. [Karl Perry] So, we are not going back into security really quickly. [Ian Palonis] give a goddamn so f***. All you got. Even though you all help me peace out, [Ian Palonis] multi-million dollar business here and now I'm rich as f*** and I don't really [Karl Perry] Yeah. Yeah. [Ian Palonis] You know, how does that not happen? [Karl Perry] And so that comes down to culture. [Kenneth Tyler] well, I think [Karl Perry] Because actually the right culture doesn't do that. [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Ian Palonis] It's like power corrupts though, right? Like you see it, you know I mean I'm [Ian Palonis] sure some of these people you see now they're think so highly of themselves and [Ian Palonis] they're crazy yachts with all their blah blah blah, you know. But I'm sure they [Ian Palonis] somehow along the way. [Ian Palonis] like it could be, it's likely that there were once idealistic, right? And [Ian Palonis] they turned into Reptilians, you know, [Kenneth Tyler] well, but you have to remember this is not [Kenneth Tyler] Listen, take place in a vacuum. [Kenneth Tyler] These communities. [Kenneth Tyler] Come about. [Kenneth Tyler] In human situations, and they are often. [Kenneth Tyler] Seen. [Kenneth Tyler] Sort of inspired when they start. [Kenneth Tyler] lots of good examples of this. [Kenneth Tyler] And the inspiration tends to fade or multiple generations. You know, there's [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Kenneth Tyler] Summer that some of the communities. [Kenneth Tyler] Have mechanisms that. [Kenneth Tyler] Sort of allow the inspiration to reignite. [Kenneth Tyler] different parts of them or whatever, but at the stage that we're at, [Kenneth Tyler] We don't have. [Kenneth Tyler] That big of a problem. [Kenneth Tyler] That we found a good thing that works. The Conflict club works for us. [Kenneth Tyler] and we think, [Kenneth Tyler] If we do something like this and some other environments, it would work there [Kenneth Tyler] too. [Kenneth Tyler] And would be people would benefit from it. [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] It seems like that's the first. [Kenneth Tyler] Testing point. [Kenneth Tyler] Could you? [Kenneth Tyler] Create something that would enable people to to. [Kenneth Tyler] Spin up a community like this. [Kenneth Tyler] Leveraging what we've learned in the Conflict Club. [Kenneth Tyler] And get similar benefits. [Karl Perry] Yeah, so there's a there's a whole bunch of threads here that [Karl Perry] i've i've traveled many of these [Ian Palonis] I, [Karl Perry] I haven't explored all of them and I haven't delivered on all of them. But one, [Karl Perry] this community of practice idea [Karl Perry] capacity and I said Well it's going to take us six months to train people. They [Karl Perry] Club. [Karl Perry] That's our starting point. I know you don't know anything about Hpta. [Karl Perry] right, but with this, four of us here now [Karl Perry] we are a community of practice so they gave me three people and said he go here, [Karl Perry] are the people that you, you're gonna turn into facilitators [Karl Perry] so, as a community of practice, [Karl Perry] space [Karl Perry] I use this the stuff that I had learned in the Conflict club, which was creative [Karl Perry] First thing we do we create a space now let's talk about what it is that we're [Karl Perry] opportunity? [Karl Perry] Step one. [Karl Perry] What is the opportunity here? [Karl Perry] And we can up with an opportunity statement. [Karl Perry] the stakeholders that are affected by the decisions that we might make in terms [Karl Perry] And we started to articulate all the interests. [Karl Perry] And then we started going. So [Karl Perry] What are the obstacles? [Karl Perry] And the undesirable effects. [Karl Perry] And so we started to explore all of those. [Karl Perry] And then what are the options that we have to overcome them now? [Karl Perry] strategy does. And it's with a three C's model comes from, as well. It captures [Karl Perry] all of the interests that I contained inside an organization, [Karl Perry] There are nine elements that sit around the outside of the three C's model. [Karl Perry] And it's those known elements that are always the interests in an organization. [Karl Perry] And so through that community of practice these, it's not all of them. One [Karl Perry] person is no longer part of that community. [Karl Perry] facilitating decided that he wasn't the right person. [Karl Perry] he still part of it but he's just not facilitating the other two who have also [Karl Perry] As we have evolved. [Karl Perry] Much of the content that was originally started. [Karl Perry] to the SO that we can deliver visa services to [Karl Perry] The improvement teams where facilitating and supporting, and we actually get [Karl Perry] paid but we all get paid by it. Ba to do that. [Karl Perry] So that's the community of practice now. [Karl Perry] because in the past working with London and working with Graham and other guy, [Karl Perry] actually having a great time working together. [Karl Perry] So we formed a community of practice. [Karl Perry] And we had a very similar conversations to the ones. We're having now, [Karl Perry] But we took that a step further and Graham helped me to actually pull a [Karl Perry] financial model together. [Karl Perry] That enables us to do. [Karl Perry] different things, but to be able to bring our own [Karl Perry] Knowledge and intuition inform it up into a course of some kind. [Karl Perry] With the support of each other, we form it up into a course. [Karl Perry] And that. [Karl Perry] They could each of us could individually deliver. [Karl Perry] own little course, our own little business. [Karl Perry] But there are three components to any small business or course. [Karl Perry] You have to. [Karl Perry] Have it delivered? Have it developed? You have to have it delivered and you have [Karl Perry] to have it sold. [Karl Perry] delivers, and there's a percentage for the person who markets [Karl Perry] can put financial things around it that that don't have the same negative [Karl Perry] So so what Graham said is, well the way that we could make it collaborative, we [Karl Perry] So, there's an affiliate fee, there's a delivery fee, and then there's an IP [Karl Perry] And the cool thing about that is when you get that kind of environment, it might [Karl Perry] be that if you might have developed the IP and then I might learn the IP. [Karl Perry] And then learn how to deliver it. So now I can actually deliver your IP [Karl Perry] actually, I don't want to deliver all [Karl Perry] Develop IP. I just want to sell it. [Karl Perry] so, I can get the affiliate component but together, [Karl Perry] And we can all choose what we've got it. [Karl Perry] But collectively. [Karl Perry] The idea is we can sell more courses. [Karl Perry] ran it and I sort of think it's perfect. [Karl Perry] We're actually starting to do exactly the same with high performance for [Karl Perry] engagement. We're starting to modulize all the content and we're talking about a [Karl Perry] collaborative way of working together, which is not funded by VA. But actually [Karl Perry] working outside of VA and looking at working with other companies. [Kenneth Tyler] I, [Karl Perry] Because we've got a interest-based problem solving module, we've got a high [Karl Perry] subscription. Tell us we'll sell us agent for 500 bucks a month. [Karl Perry] We'll make it a thousand bucks a month, just to make it easy. [Karl Perry] King. So every time that agent gets sold that subscription gets sold, whoever [Karl Perry] sold it gets for example 30%. [Karl Perry] whoever maintains the agent gets 30% and whoever keen, for example who developed [Karl Perry] now, he might leave it, never deliver it or sell it, but [Karl Perry] He still gets 30% every time. It's sold because it was his IP [Karl Perry] And I'll tell you what, if he gets that down to, he gets that down to a [Karl Perry] producible product. [Karl Perry] I will want to learn how to deliver that. [Karl Perry] And I'll definitely be selling it. [Karl Perry] because I can be successful that way, but every time I'm successful every time I [Karl Perry] sell one of Kings products, [Karl Perry] three. [Karl Perry] In which case he takes all three proportions of it. [Karl Perry] And you might have a prompt engineer. [Karl Perry] You might be able to do a, you might have a, an offer, a product, a service, [Karl Perry] And that's your IP. [Ian Palonis] too. [Ian Palonis] But I mean, I see, I see what you're saying as a potential template or [Ian Palonis] within the current. [Ian Palonis] Paradigm, I guess for lack of a better word of potential economic model that's [Ian Palonis] financial like, we know, [Kenneth Tyler] the thing is, [Karl Perry] What? [Kenneth Tyler] I think. [Kenneth Tyler] What you're talking about Karl. [Kenneth Tyler] Or at least the way I would think of it is. [Kenneth Tyler] Once a group has established. [Kenneth Tyler] It's taking the first step. [Kenneth Tyler] Sharing with each other. [Kenneth Tyler] Then they can do lots of stuff. [Kenneth Tyler] I wanted things they could do is erect the kind of model you're talking about. [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Kenneth Tyler] which, [Kenneth Tyler] Would not really work. [Kenneth Tyler] without the culture, the underlying culture [Kenneth Tyler] right, of [Kenneth Tyler] Of. [Kenneth Tyler] The group commitment and sharing. [Kenneth Tyler] but, [Kenneth Tyler] I think that. [Kenneth Tyler] The relatively small groups, who, who trust each other and share. [Kenneth Tyler] To generate much more powerful potentials than that. [Kenneth Tyler] There could they could support. [Kenneth Tyler] All kinds of infrastructures. [Kenneth Tyler] You know which, which would be good. [Kenneth Tyler] one of the interesting things if there was a way for such groups to share with [Kenneth Tyler] each other, [Kenneth Tyler] Would be this sort of heaven. Say, Well, look, what we did with this, with this [Kenneth Tyler] And give people ideas and stuff. [Kenneth Tyler] Right now, I'm sort of myself sort of stuck on the basic. [Kenneth Tyler] thinking about, I mean, these small groups of existed in people have done this, [Kenneth Tyler] And started businesses on top of it. I don't care for a long time. [Kenneth Tyler] What does the MLM add? And what does it add in particular in our situation? [Kenneth Tyler] People's work experiences, pretty much uniformly. [Kenneth Tyler] Terrible. [Kenneth Tyler] How could it add it? [Kenneth Tyler] Sort of from the bottom up and a sharing model does that. It's like [Kenneth Tyler] if three people in a company decide to search sharing with each other, [Kenneth Tyler] It really has nothing to do with the company. [Kenneth Tyler] But it will boost their performance. [Kenneth Tyler] You know. [Karl Perry] Let me run, let me run something. So say being comes to the conflict club as you [Karl Perry] did the other day. [Karl Perry] And he says, I have this problem. [Karl Perry] That keeps showing up in my environment. [Karl Perry] And we go, oh, that sucks. [Karl Perry] Okay, would you want to hang Do you want a hand solving resolving that you want [Karl Perry] to come up with a solution? [Karl Perry] Yes I do. Okay. Well let's do an evaporating cloud. We'll do that as a community [Karl Perry] this all the time, we have a problem, okay. So when you solve this problem, [Karl Perry] Because we will help you to solve this. And once you've had that IP [Karl Perry] Join up with a solution and then we'll help you satellite solution. [Karl Perry] In the meantime, you can go and sell it to the people. [Karl Perry] That, you know who already have the problem. [Karl Perry] so, [Karl Perry] I would imagine if we went back through the Conflict Club records, we would find [Karl Perry] that there are so many solutions that are potentially salable. [Karl Perry] That we could turn into. [Karl Perry] A. [Karl Perry] small course, or [Karl Perry] Some kind of training or some offer. [Karl Perry] And once we've turned it into that then we need to take it to market. And and if [Karl Perry] and if somebody has already [Karl Perry] built it and [Karl Perry] Is don't can deliver it. I will sell it. [Karl Perry] be happy to sell bean stuff. [Karl Perry] I'd be happy to sell your stuff. Ian, I'd be happy to sell your stuff game. I'd [Karl Perry] In fact, I can't wait to see. Okay, I'm gonna encourage you to actually [Karl Perry] I'm gonna encourage you to come up with more stuff. [Ian Palonis] I wonder how this. [Karl Perry] Whatever it is. [Ian Palonis] I mean, I could see [Ian Palonis] You recall my comment about like and this might be new to you can but Karl and [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Karl Perry] That. [Ian Palonis] I could see my local goat farmer joining it, and I could see members come in and [Ian Palonis] like, [Ian Palonis] gonna give me some awesome milk and I, you know what I mean? Like, so I wonder [Ian Palonis] what you're saying Karl and you know, I wonder how that [Ian Palonis] have to be people like quote, unquote us who [Ian Palonis] possibility, affects things like Is this, who's Part of this community does just [Ian Palonis] think about [Ian Palonis] You know, Tech Solutions, training solution. You know what I mean? Like, [Kenneth Tyler] The first. [Karl Perry] buy them. [Karl Perry] there are some courses that she writes that I wouldn't run because I just don't [Karl Perry] I also wouldn't sell them but that doesn't make them wrong. They're just not for [Karl Perry] Ian, I guarantee, if you ain't had a check with you. There are some of the [Karl Perry] courses that she could tell you, she could take you through you'd go. Actually, [Karl Perry] like [Karl Perry] There are so many different things for so, many different people. [Karl Perry] It doesn't suit everyone. [Karl Perry] But that's okay. [Karl Perry] We create a community where all of these things are possible. [Kenneth Tyler] The Basic. [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Karl Perry] I'm not sure about the guy, I'm not sure about the goat farmer, but yeah, we'll [Karl Perry] have to work on there. [Kenneth Tyler] Basic rule is you don't know in advance. [Kenneth Tyler] The community. [Kenneth Tyler] To be effective, has to be open to anybody. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Which isn't to say. [Kenneth Tyler] That it allows that it has no. [Kenneth Tyler] Immune system. [Kenneth Tyler] that then you want to go on to run, [Kenneth Tyler] but it it's just like not deciding in advance auto structure the application [Kenneth Tyler] When what you're doing is preempting the lm's major strength. [Kenneth Tyler] So deciding in advance. [Kenneth Tyler] Who would benefit from your community? [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Kenneth Tyler] Is probably a similar move. It's your preempting, your communities. [Kenneth Tyler] Major. [Kenneth Tyler] I mean, one of its major foundational. [Kenneth Tyler] Points. [Ian Palonis] Hmm. [Kenneth Tyler] so, it's like, [Kenneth Tyler] The basic trust and sharing. [Kenneth Tyler] is not because, or [Kenneth Tyler] to increase, or [Kenneth Tyler] It's it's to transcend that current circumstances. [Kenneth Tyler] and then, [Kenneth Tyler] All kinds of things become possible. [Kenneth Tyler] but it's being mistake to [Kenneth Tyler] Try and substitute that ianic of those things that dynamic of the community, the [Kenneth Tyler] community needs support. [Kenneth Tyler] Activity at the base level. [Kenneth Tyler] As well as the things, the superstructures that it then makes possible. [Ian Palonis] it's interesting because like, yeah, [Ian Palonis] Everything you guys have been saying is really resonating strongly with me and [Ian Palonis] it was interesting, too. Is, can you have a way of like just [Ian Palonis] say, [Ian Palonis] Well yet, hopefully sometime if I make it. [Ian Palonis] I'll be able to do what you do. I hope but like [Ian Palonis] now, and after the same, not for the same, not [Karl Perry] You already doing it and you're just doing it in your right? Yeah. You're [Karl Perry] already doing it. You're doing it in your own way. [Karl Perry] That. [Ian Palonis] I'll be in a similar if I can find a lucky enough to make it that long. But what [Ian Palonis] introspections that kind of done, you know, like I'm hoping that someday maybe [Ian Palonis] Yeah but if I had 40 more years to like to do all the reading and it's like an [Ian Palonis] we can't know up front and trying to know will be detrimental. Like we have to [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Ian Palonis] We have to learn to surf. Emergency set complexity and emergence. Yeah. And [Karl Perry] and one of, [Ian Palonis] Again, it's the fundamental foundational dynamic that will allow us to do that, [Karl Perry] The great things of some of the stuff that kings come over culture has come out [Karl Perry] keen. [Karl Perry] things that really spiked me was thinking about the three seasons and [Karl Perry] current state is. [Karl Perry] So, every decision needs to be made in the context of the three C's in the first [Karl Perry] Is how does it impact the culture? [Karl Perry] talking about the internal culture, [Karl Perry] decision. [Karl Perry] We will not pursue that any further that's the first test. The second test is [Karl Perry] And if the answer to that is no, then we don't go any further. [Karl Perry] And in the last question is, will they pay for it? [Ian Palonis] I, [Karl Perry] Because if it adds value, then they'll pay for it. And then the only question [Karl Perry] there is how much will they pay for it? [Karl Perry] and if we can make decisions based on those three, those three C's [Karl Perry] Then we will be making a good decision. That is the navigation. [Karl Perry] If it only focuses on one of those seas. [Karl Perry] Then it's probably not. It's not a good decision and we shouldn't we shouldn't [Karl Perry] progress it any further. [Karl Perry] That's the navigation. It's also the thing that removes the conflict [Karl Perry] The silos and the waste out of traditional organizations. [Karl Perry] why I'm excited about starting this from an organization that doesn't already [Karl Perry] come up with? [Karl Perry] When we make decisions as an organization as a body together? [Karl Perry] It has to be based on those three C's. What infrastructure do we need in? Place [Karl Perry] to do that. [Karl Perry] And I don't know the answer to that, I know bits of it. [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Ian Palonis] time. [Ian Palonis] but like, [Ian Palonis] level could could be interesting. You know. It could be interesting to talk [Ian Palonis] Yeah, I feel like we're at a point where maybe like getting tactical to some [Ian Palonis] I've also noticed Ken that you don't like flattery very much. [Karl Perry] ? [Ian Palonis] like. [Ian Palonis] Don't take well to it, at least. [Ian Palonis] So I don't know. What do you guys think? Like, you know, shall we break like, [Ian Palonis] you know, [Ian Palonis] you need to do, like, what you guys want to do from. [Ian Palonis] Just like step up from a second. [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Karl Perry] Mixtapes. [Kenneth Tyler] There's a [Kenneth Tyler] limit for any given conversation, but what's interesting is that [Kenneth Tyler] We already have a group. [Kenneth Tyler] A sharing and supporting food. [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Kenneth Tyler] You know, it's there because it [Kenneth Tyler] You can see it working. [Kenneth Tyler] and then, [Kenneth Tyler] Ian's been talking with people. [Kenneth Tyler] About who might be, you have some kind of interest. [Kenneth Tyler] and some [Ian Palonis] in being part of such a group, [Kenneth Tyler] In being such a group. [Karl Perry] He? [Kenneth Tyler] and so, [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Kenneth Tyler] Question is, do we know? [Kenneth Tyler] It's like starting a fire without matches. [Kenneth Tyler] There's a trick to. [Kenneth Tyler] And I suspect Ian would like to see those people have a group. [Ian Palonis] Or be part of our group. This other group, you know, like, [Karl Perry] Yeah. Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah. [Karl Perry] so, [Kenneth Tyler] I suspect that. [Kenneth Tyler] Imagining. [Kenneth Tyler] Unlimited girls is probably not. [Kenneth Tyler] The workable. But [Karl Perry] ago. [Karl Perry] So, the Conflict Club, the group itself gave me an indicator about three months [Karl Perry] When it said we should turn this into a business. [Karl Perry] I think either came from Julian or it came from being [Karl Perry] We should turn this into a business. Yeah, a consulting business because we've [Karl Perry] got a bunch of people here who know more about how to evaporate conflict than [Karl Perry] That came from Grant. [Karl Perry] And I kind of went, you know what, I think, when I get some time, I want to look [Karl Perry] same thing. [Karl Perry] How do we turn this into a business that would support all of us? [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] Not just this though, a platform for other thing, other things like it to [Ian Palonis] maybe maybe at some point it grows in that way. I don't know, but like new kind [Ian Palonis] things, you know. [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Ian Palonis] kind, I don't know. [Karl Perry] Yeah, well, the first one is get a sell. [Karl Perry] Oh, we've got one. [Karl Perry] now, how do we [Karl Perry] With the coaches already, right? [Karl Perry] And we can continue to support that. We do that really well. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Karl Perry] I could probably think of a number of different reasons why the culture is the [Karl Perry] way that it is. [Karl Perry] A lot of that has to do with the structure that we bring to the conversation. [Karl Perry] The fact that we problem solve together and we've been doing that for quite some [Karl Perry] time, that is the key to constructive culture. [Karl Perry] for problem solving, you need to have subject matter expertise [Karl Perry] And you need some sort of rational problem solving capability. [Karl Perry] happening in the conflict club. [Karl Perry] You bring those three things together and a group will thrive. The culture of [Karl Perry] We have those three conditions. [Karl Perry] However, brings a problem already, has the subject matter expertise. Plus we've [Karl Perry] got something like cogito who also has subject matter expertise beyond our [Karl Perry] It will access to it. So we've got there, we've got this interpersonal behavior, [Karl Perry] And I'm talking affiliate of humanistic encouraging self-actualized and [Karl Perry] familiar with them. [Karl Perry] rational thinking process all the time to solve problems, let's have a culture [Karl Perry] has has become what it has. [Karl Perry] That's why people want to stay. [Karl Perry] And keep coming back. [Karl Perry] Because we've got those three things in place so cultures, right? We need to [Karl Perry] think well, so, who might be a customer for something that we might? [Karl Perry] Do we might do together. [Karl Perry] And then, how do we all collectively benefit from it? [Karl Perry] Commercially. [Karl Perry] I don't know the answer to those questions, but [Karl Perry] if we were to have a group session, [Karl Perry] To do that to have a conversation about it. And say, the culture here is great, [Karl Perry] we've got some great problem, solving capabilities, [Karl Perry] something to, and we can all commercially benefit from [Karl Perry] Or. [Karl Perry] Pick one thing. [Karl Perry] And say. [Karl Perry] And like, I'm [Karl Perry] Let's pick cogito. [Karl Perry] King Cogito now works. [Karl Perry] King, would you be be prepared? But we'll put it. We'll put a price on it and [Karl Perry] all of the conflict club. [Karl Perry] We've been working with you on it and to help you develop it but now it's in a [Karl Perry] Um, we'll put a price on it and each of us will go out and sell it to somebody. [Karl Perry] affiliate fee, you'll obviously can get the the FIFA developing it. [Karl Perry] And in return for that, if we individually, sell it to somebody, we'll get the [Karl Perry] It's just an affiliate program. [Karl Perry] We've got that, we've got the technology for that already. [Karl Perry] And then see. [Karl Perry] The cool thing is every time we have a problem. [Karl Perry] Without organization. [Karl Perry] We know, has solved it. [Kenneth Tyler] Oh yeah. [Ian Palonis] I, [Kenneth Tyler] I'm really interested. [Kenneth Tyler] I'm [Kenneth Tyler] Suffering a little bit from overload. [Kenneth Tyler] because of, [Kenneth Tyler] problem, and kind of [Kenneth Tyler] Keeping up, and [Kenneth Tyler] Trying to shed. [Karl Perry] E. [Kenneth Tyler] Ideas that are kind of built in. [Kenneth Tyler] See, where the real. [Kenneth Tyler] Kind of benefits might lie. [Karl Perry] Oh, so you need a group of people to help you continue to develop it so you can [Karl Perry] get it to a point that it's available. [Kenneth Tyler] He accept you probably shouldn't think about it as a singular. [Kenneth Tyler] and then, [Kenneth Tyler] Or. [Kenneth Tyler] Thing. [Karl Perry] Though, it's ongoing. [Kenneth Tyler] No. [Karl Perry] It's exactly what the community does. It'll just [Kenneth Tyler] I just meant. [Karl Perry] been incredible. Like the value, the value has been amazing. [Karl Perry] I'll tell you what, they, they prompted for me. The the AI generator agent [Karl Perry] And we have some serious cross-border, tax problems. [Karl Perry] That we're trying to work through. [Karl Perry] days, which means I'm now officially a tech resident in the UK. [Karl Perry] When I say take like, I've been in the, I've been in the in the UK for over 183 [Karl Perry] And not in New Zealand. [Karl Perry] Well, it's a problem because they have a company. [Karl Perry] I've got some technicalities to work out anyway so I took that prompt and [Karl Perry] in some project knowledge and then I asked the the last chords to write me a [Karl Perry] prompt. [Karl Perry] specialist. [Karl Perry] And it wrote me an agent, that did it. [Karl Perry] And it went to the IRD in New Zealand and it went to the HMRC and it went to [Karl Perry] Deloitte's and it went to a whole bunch of other places that got all the [Karl Perry] And it created an agent for me. And then I create, I got the agent up and [Karl Perry] And then asked it to give me some advice. [Karl Perry] field. [Karl Perry] And it was absolutely bang on. [Karl Perry] restructuring stuff, and it's all part of that whole obligation thing. [Karl Perry] and said, [Karl Perry] Okay, I need Aliso for our specialist, that relates to this because she needs [Karl Perry] all this information. And it said, here it is, it's the report she needs, and [Karl Perry] would have taken me a week to write that [Karl Perry] And even Allison was going. [Karl Perry] This is unbelievable. But how on earth like this is this is it's got stuff in it [Karl Perry] that we would never have thought of [Karl Perry] Is something really valuable and what you're doing with that. [Karl Perry] How do we, how do we turn that? [Karl Perry] And that's a product. [Ian Palonis] building of this, the community. [Karl Perry] Mm-hmm. [Ian Palonis] And I'm keen on those effects that you're talking about too obviously. But I'm [Ian Palonis] really keen on like the thing that generates these things and then gets them up [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] But I like, I like that fund the layer down that you're talking at and how your [Karl Perry] I mean, I have a A training course that I could deliver well the lsi [Karl Perry] You're familiar with that one. [Karl Perry] I've got this coaching program and I would really like you as a community to [Karl Perry] I've got the IP. [Karl Perry] And I do the delivery. So I'm going to get 60% of whatever it sells for [Karl Perry] If you sell us as an affiliate, you get this. [Karl Perry] Right. Does anybody else Does anybody want to do that? Because there's a [Karl Perry] community. This is a, This is how you came. [Karl Perry] Make money. [Ian Palonis] Well, I have these engineers that are really talented. That I know that maybe [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] there, if they're part of that. That's why. Like, I'm not one of the things that [Ian Palonis] the diverse diversify, the skill set, like I can see them. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] Being supportive with Ken and what he's doing, right? And immediate value to [Ian Palonis] you know that's why I guess [Ian Palonis] like, you know, something that they agree on that's I don't even know. But like, [Karl Perry] So so Graham was taught his talk to me about this as well, right? So when you [Karl Perry] look at and I'm really, I am putting commercials on it because without the [Karl Perry] commercial life without commercials an organization doesn't exist. [Karl Perry] I mean, we could carry on without any commercials at all. We won't sell [Karl Perry] It was just give stuff away. [Karl Perry] but I don't think that same thing because we actually are going to have to [Karl Perry] Some. [Karl Perry] We're going to have to invest in stuff. [Karl Perry] He's exactly, yeah. [Ian Palonis] To build organizations, we could invest in infrastructure and buildings and we [Ian Palonis] different things happen, you know. [Karl Perry] so, we need to be commercially responsible, but we also hit [Karl Perry] That's exactly right. [Ian Palonis] we're trying to get the other foot across but we have to other people have to, [Ian Palonis] But it's it's like one foot in the old paradigm and one foot in the new and then [Karl Perry] A hundred percent. Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah and I'm I mean I'm quite excited by their prospect. I'm kind of already [Karl Perry] But it's only in its infancy. [Karl Perry] I'd love to do it with the [Karl Perry] With the Conflict Club. [Karl Perry] Because I'm sure that Julian being Bruno. [Karl Perry] I am, they've all got things. [Karl Perry] That I would like to share with the world. [Karl Perry] And I would like them to receive remuneration and satisfaction for the work that [Karl Perry] they've done. [Karl Perry] And I'd also like to benefit from the work that they've done. [Karl Perry] It's kind of like a cooperative. [Kenneth Tyler] So, I'm left with the [Kenneth Tyler] Possibility here. [Kenneth Tyler] So we have this conflict called thing. We have resources. [Kenneth Tyler] We have stuff going on. [Kenneth Tyler] one of the questions I have is, [Kenneth Tyler] because one of my ideas about how [Kenneth Tyler] you might structure a larger groupings is [Kenneth Tyler] Would it be plausible? [Kenneth Tyler] To construct. [Kenneth Tyler] An avatar. [Kenneth Tyler] That was the conflict club. [Kenneth Tyler] that the people in the conflict club would be comfortable, having [Kenneth Tyler] Having to be there. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] An avatar would sort of be like. [Ian Palonis] I, [Kenneth Tyler] An LLM version of Karl. [Kenneth Tyler] or something that [Kenneth Tyler] Could. [Karl Perry] I, [Kenneth Tyler] Be part of other conversations. [Kenneth Tyler] There are some people and they're having this conversation and they decide [Kenneth Tyler] they're gonna plug in the conflict club. [Kenneth Tyler] But instead of trying to get on our calendars and decide, which of us is going [Kenneth Tyler] They just plug in the avatar. [Kenneth Tyler] And they talk with it. [Kenneth Tyler] What's up with the conflict club? [Karl Perry] That all of this in it. [Kenneth Tyler] to [Kenneth Tyler] and potentially they fought, they come back through the avatar and say We want [Kenneth Tyler] We want to become an affiliate, we want to. [Kenneth Tyler] We're sharing stuff and we want to put our pool of shared stuff. [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Kenneth Tyler] we're another sharing group and we want to share our experience, being sharing [Kenneth Tyler] We want a medical. [Kenneth Tyler] We're willing to commit to some kind of to a meta context. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Some of the people who engage the avatar might not make that move. [Kenneth Tyler] Right. But [Kenneth Tyler] But basically, the avatar can go talk to many more people than we can talk to. [Karl Perry] All the skylability is unbelievable. What I'm [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Ian Palonis] could even have a dialogues on their own, like you've kind of alluded to and see [Ian Palonis] what I have. And then we could have, you know, avatars representing groups and [Ian Palonis] and and like, that's the thing that we could sell eventually, you know, [Karl Perry] Yeah. And a central and something. [Karl Perry] That that Ian. You've got an avatar? Can you create an avatar? Oh, [Karl Perry] Oh look. And then we're getting them to talk with each other. [Karl Perry] but literally, you created an agent that builds an agent, [Karl Perry] And that and came, you've got it, you've built an agent that that actually [Karl Perry] participates in group conversation. [Karl Perry] I've got an agent that is A is a cross-border tax specialist. [Karl Perry] So yeah, I just don't know where we can go, but I think that there is like [Karl Perry] from the work that we do collaboratively. [Ian Palonis] I can see this though being a proving ground for something that [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Ian Palonis] commodities, you know, the turning into a sailable product, you know? [Ian Palonis] I mean, just loosely considering it, see you could have immense potential, you [Karl Perry] Yeah, a hundred percent. [Karl Perry] But where's the start? [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Ian Palonis] Which is almost like full circle because that frees up the war machine. Yeah. [Karl Perry] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] the first question is, [Ian Palonis] That's the sale. [Kenneth Tyler] What kind of access? [Kenneth Tyler] Does the LM need? [Kenneth Tyler] To be able to speak for the group. [Kenneth Tyler] If you if we had it an interface. [Kenneth Tyler] That the group could access. [Kenneth Tyler] Other than the actual. [Kenneth Tyler] Transcript of the group conversations. [Kenneth Tyler] And it might not need to be anything else more than that. [Kenneth Tyler] What? Maybe I just answered my own question. [Kenneth Tyler] when we build up a certain base of the group, [Kenneth Tyler] Conversation with each other. [Kenneth Tyler] BLM might? [Kenneth Tyler] Be able with that as a base. [Kenneth Tyler] To engage in conversation with others. [Kenneth Tyler] As an avatar of the group. [Ian Palonis] I, [Kenneth Tyler] It would be really interesting to see what, what that was like and how [Kenneth Tyler] uncomfortable it made the people in the group. [Karl Perry] Yeah, and so I think the answer to that is build it inside the group and let us [Karl Perry] And we, [Ian Palonis] I mean, it could. [Karl Perry] out and sell it to somebody. [Karl Perry] Yeah. Absolutely. And then and if it works one of us, like if it works I will go [Karl Perry] need to introduce to this person here. [Karl Perry] The the day, the day that somebody from the Conflict Club does that? [Karl Perry] There's, I really want to sell this to somebody. [Karl Perry] Then you'll know that it's working. [Karl Perry] Hmm. [Ian Palonis] avatars and we could be having this conversation but you two are not physically, [Kenneth Tyler] That wasn't, that was an idea. But I'm beginning to suspect [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Karl Perry] And if you can, [Kenneth Tyler] It makes it unnecessarily complicated. [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Kenneth Tyler] that it [Kenneth Tyler] If you wanted to have a conversation, [Karl Perry] It's really ironic because we've all three of us have built our own ones, which [Kenneth Tyler] and he thinks I should talk this over this. I want to talk with him about this [Kenneth Tyler] Which is great and probably would have great results. But if he talks with the [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Kenneth Tyler] You know, being the cleaning out of the air. [Kenneth Tyler] As some really critical contribution. [Kenneth Tyler] that Ian wouldn't have thought of [Kenneth Tyler] That it would. [Kenneth Tyler] Wouldn't know. [Karl Perry] Yeah. Now this is the that's because you've got the group, the group synergy, [Karl Perry] but that's important. [Kenneth Tyler] Because the the group is a kind of an expanded context that has potentials. [Kenneth Tyler] That. [Kenneth Tyler] are all that, you know you're lying to [Karl Perry] Mmm. [Kenneth Tyler] We don't know. We could try building individual avatars and a group avatar, but [Kenneth Tyler] A group will one will be shockingly effective. [Ian Palonis] Hmm, makes a lot of sense. [Karl Perry] What do you need? What, what do you need for that? [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Kenneth Tyler] I just need to. [Kenneth Tyler] To have a coherent collection of transcripts. [Kenneth Tyler] What's happening now? [Kenneth Tyler] is the [Kenneth Tyler] In theory. [Kenneth Tyler] Like when we in this meeting, [Kenneth Tyler] The cogito was symbol. [Kenneth Tyler] A transcript. [Kenneth Tyler] And then it will embed it. [Kenneth Tyler] So that an LLM can talk to it. [Karl Perry] I, [Kenneth Tyler] As opposed to just storing the text. [Kenneth Tyler] Right. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Kenneth Tyler] once they're like 10 meetings, then you could [Kenneth Tyler] Try out having a conversation with the group. [Karl Perry] All right, so with the three of us, we need to have 10 meetings about building [Karl Perry] an organization. [Karl Perry] Right? It's just a conversation. We've had in more. [Karl Perry] Technically strategically. [Karl Perry] What is, what are we going to do to maintain the culture with us? We're going to [Karl Perry] leave the conflict club to this place. [Karl Perry] And at some point we will say to other because we're going to be a cell. [Karl Perry] From within the Conflict Club. [Karl Perry] That's going to lead and govern. [Karl Perry] And then, we're going to invite other people into that cell. But to start with, [Karl Perry] we'll just get it running. [Ian Palonis] I'm game for whatever. But [Ian Palonis] You know. [Karl Perry] Yeah, yeah. So I was thinking more about getting the cogito. [Karl Perry] With enough transcripts. So let's just you the, what if we if we get, well, four [Karl Perry] or five, be enough, [Karl Perry] and what we'll talk about over the next couple of weeks. [Karl Perry] and then, [Kenneth Tyler] well, assuming assuming this this transfer [Karl Perry] I want to give. [Karl Perry] Back to, I want to give Coach toe to the conflict club and say, Hey, have a [Karl Perry] As three four sessions. [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah. [Karl Perry] That's how we engage them. [Kenneth Tyler] It's hard for me to keep up. Sometimes Karl. [Kenneth Tyler] You're a great one for plunging. Right? In. [Karl Perry] Over here. That's action. That's called fiction. Let's go, let's go out because [Kenneth Tyler] The. [Ian Palonis] I, [Karl Perry] You know what, they, they really good example. The fact that I put my own meter [Karl Perry] AI coach prompt in the Comfort Club. [Karl Perry] prompt in Claude and then ran the rent in the conflict club and ran the RAN the [Karl Perry] It was a mistake. [Karl Perry] But it was a beautiful mistake because it actually did something to that cloud. [Karl Perry] and now I know something more about how to prompt the prompt [Kenneth Tyler] Within, with an LLM in the room, there are no mistakes. [Karl Perry] There are no undesirable effects because none of those things actually exist. [Karl Perry] They're all illusions that we've created for ourselves. [Kenneth Tyler] Well. [Kenneth Tyler] We each our point of view. [Kenneth Tyler] Let me. [Kenneth Tyler] Look at what. What? [Kenneth Tyler] Transcript. [Kenneth Tyler] Is of this meeting. [Ian Palonis via chat] Cogito, what are your thoughts about this entire conversation? What insights can you bring as we near an end? [Cogito via chat] Based on the conversation, a few key insights emerge:

1) The group is exploring ways to leverage the collaborative culture and problem-solving capabilities of the "Conflict Club" to develop commercial offerings and generate mutual prosperity. There is a focus on creating a supportive, trust-based community that can transcend rigid organizational structures.

2) Integrating an AI assistant like myself into this process is seen as a way to enhance the group's collective intelligence and amplify their ability to ideate, develop, and distribute innovative solutions. The participants are considering how to create an "avatar" that can represent and engage the Conflict Club community.

3) Ultimately, the group seems driven by a desire to create a new paradigm for business and human flourishing - one that prioritizes human relationships, empathy, and mutual support over narrow self-interest. They view this as a path to unlocking the true potential of both individuals and the collective. [Karl Perry] That's what Ian. [Kenneth Tyler] I'll send you some, I'll send you some clues. [Kenneth Tyler] About how to prompt it. [Kenneth Tyler] To. [Kenneth Tyler] To actually talk to this meeting. [Kenneth Tyler] Let me see. [Kenneth Tyler] Can I share my screen? [Ian Palonis] At the bottom and the buttons. [Ian Palonis] Up. [Kenneth Tyler] Yeah. [Kenneth Tyler] Kinda go reading. [Karl Perry] Well, just now that didn't it, three points, perfect. [Karl Perry] And the chat. [Karl Perry] so, [Kenneth Tyler] All right. [Kenneth Tyler] Screen sharing. [Ian Palonis] Yep. [Ian Palonis] Create. [Kenneth Tyler] Is it coming through? [Ian Palonis] Yep. [Ian Palonis] Create. [Kenneth Tyler] Okay, so [Kenneth Tyler] I have to get rid of story arc and analysis, but [Karl Perry via chat] Cogito what do we do next? [Kenneth Tyler] I'll go to the first tab Karl. [Cogito via chat] Based on the conversation, it seems the key next steps the group is considering are:

1) Compiling a set of transcripts from their "Conflict Club" meetings to use as a foundation for developing an AI "avatar" that can represent and engage with the group's collective knowledge and problem-solving capabilities. 

2) Exploring ways to leverage the trust-based culture and collaborative problem-solving of the Conflict Club to develop commercial offerings that can generate mutual prosperity for the members, while staying true to their principles of empathy and community.

The group appears eager to move forward in a thoughtful, intentional manner that maintains the integrity of their group dynamic. Their focus is on unlocking the full potential of both human and artificial intelligence to create a new paradigm for business and human flourishing. [Kenneth Tyler] Talk to the meeting. [Kenneth Tyler] Well, we're [Kenneth Tyler] Building up is a. [Kenneth Tyler] A set of. [Kenneth Tyler] Transcripts of meetings. [Kenneth Tyler] But it's also. [Kenneth Tyler] Capable of generating. [Kenneth Tyler] And this is a really cool simple one map. So the meeting that sort of show [Kenneth Tyler] How different parts of it are. [Kenneth Tyler] Dispersed in the congregational space. In the conversational space. [Kenneth Tyler] but, [Kenneth Tyler] At any rate, the trick would be. [Kenneth Tyler] To go to the first tab. [Kenneth Tyler] and then, [Kenneth Tyler] Type in, I want to talk about such and such a meeting. [Kenneth Tyler] See what it has just. [Karl Perry] Can you can you can you can you ask about the meeting we're having right now? [Kenneth Tyler] No, because the transcript isn't generated. Well, no. [Kenneth Tyler] A transcript is. [Ian Palonis] I, [Kenneth Tyler] Captured on the fly. [Kenneth Tyler] But I don't know that. [Kenneth Tyler] That this UI has access to it. If we're in Claude code, we could probably talk [Kenneth Tyler] Because it would know how to read the [Kenneth Tyler] Fragments of the transcript that have come in. [Kenneth Tyler] but in order to do it here, [Kenneth Tyler] you know, it implies that [Kenneth Tyler] One thing about meetings should be when action, that should be should be [Kenneth Tyler] discussed. [Kenneth Tyler] Which should open a conversation focused on that meeting. [Kenneth Tyler] so, [Karl Perry] Are you any you only need one transcript for that, right? [Kenneth Tyler] Well, we can, you can try it with this meeting. As soon as we get a transcript [Kenneth Tyler] And it's just, [Kenneth Tyler] I'm not certain what the idiom. [Kenneth Tyler] You need to use what the language you need to use is. [Karl Perry] Right. [Kenneth Tyler] To. [Kenneth Tyler] You know. [Kenneth Tyler] I don't think it can do it. [Kenneth Tyler] Right now, we can ask it the [Kenneth Tyler] I, [Karl Perry] Is that the meeting we're in right now? [Kenneth Tyler] No, that's a past one.
