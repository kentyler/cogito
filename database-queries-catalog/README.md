# Database Queries Catalog

This directory contains one file per source file, cataloging all database queries found in that file.

## Structure
- Each `.md` file corresponds to a source file with database queries
- Example: `server-routes-meetings-crud.md` catalogs queries in `server/routes/meetings-crud.js`

## Goal
Systematically catalog every database query to design comprehensive DatabaseAgent methods that will replace all scattered queries.

## Progress
- [ ] Server routes (highest priority - API endpoints)
- [ ] Server services (business logic)
- [ ] Lib modules (utilities and agents)
- [ ] Scripts (migration and maintenance)

## Status: Starting with server routes
