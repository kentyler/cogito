# WebSocket System

## Purpose
WebSocket communication system for real-time bidirectional communication between clients and server. Provides live updates, real-time conversation streaming, and instant notifications for enhanced user experience.

## WebSocket Architecture (Placeholder)

### Current Status
This directory is currently empty but is reserved for WebSocket implementation. The WebSocket system would handle:

- Real-time conversation streaming
- Live turn updates during LLM response generation  
- Instant notifications for system events
- Collaborative features and presence indicators
- File upload progress updates
- Meeting status synchronization

### Planned WebSocket Components

#### `websocket-server.js` (Future)
**Purpose**: WebSocket server initialization and connection management
- Establishes WebSocket server alongside Express HTTP server
- Manages client connection lifecycle and authentication
- Handles connection pooling and resource management
- Provides connection health monitoring and cleanup

#### `connection-handler.js` (Future)  
**Purpose**: Individual client connection management
- Handles WebSocket connection establishment and teardown
- Manages client authentication and session validation
- Implements connection-specific message routing
- Provides per-connection state management

#### `message-router.js` (Future)
**Purpose**: WebSocket message routing and processing
- Routes incoming messages to appropriate handlers
- Implements message validation and security
- Manages message queuing for offline clients
- Provides message broadcasting capabilities

#### `real-time-conversation.js` (Future)
**Purpose**: Real-time conversation streaming
- Streams LLM responses as they are generated
- Updates conversation state in real-time
- Handles typing indicators and presence
- Manages conversation synchronization across clients

## Future Implementation Patterns

### WebSocket Integration with Existing Systems
```javascript
// Future WebSocket integration pattern
export class WebSocketIntegration {
  async broadcastConversationUpdate(meetingId, turnData) {
    // 1. Find all clients connected to meeting
    // 2. Broadcast turn update to connected clients
    // 3. Handle disconnected clients gracefully
  }
  
  async streamLLMResponse(clientId, responseStream) {
    // 1. Stream LLM response chunks to client
    // 2. Update UI with incremental content
    // 3. Handle streaming interruptions
  }
}
```

### Authentication Integration
```javascript
// Future authentication pattern for WebSocket
export class WebSocketAuth {
  async authenticateConnection(socket, token) {
    // 1. Validate WebSocket authentication token
    // 2. Associate connection with user session
    // 3. Apply client access permissions
  }
}
```

## Database Integration (Future)

### WebSocket Session Management
- `websocketOperations.createConnection(connectionData)` - Track active connections
- `websocketOperations.updateConnectionStatus(connectionId, status)` - Update connection state
- `websocketOperations.getActiveConnections(clientId)` - Get client connections
- `websocketOperations.cleanupConnection(connectionId)` - Clean up disconnected clients

### Real-time Event Logging
- `eventOperations.logWebSocketEvent(eventData)` - Log WebSocket events
- `eventOperations.getConnectionMetrics(timeRange)` - Connection analytics
- `eventOperations.getMessageVolume(clientId, timeRange)` - Message statistics

## Security Considerations (Future)

### WebSocket Security
- Connection authentication and authorization
- Message validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for WebSocket messages
- CSRF protection for WebSocket endpoints
- Secure WebSocket (WSS) in production

### Privacy and Data Protection  
- Message encryption for sensitive communications
- Connection logging with privacy compliance
- Client isolation and data access controls
- Audit trails for real-time communications

## Performance Optimization (Future)

### Connection Management
- Connection pooling and resource limits
- Automatic cleanup of idle connections  
- Message queuing for high-volume scenarios
- Load balancing across WebSocket instances

### Real-time Streaming
- Efficient message broadcasting
- Chunked response streaming for large content
- Compression for message payloads
- Connection health monitoring and reconnection

## Testing Strategies (Future)

### WebSocket Testing
- Connection establishment and authentication testing
- Message routing and broadcasting validation  
- Real-time streaming performance testing
- Connection cleanup and resource management testing
- Integration testing with existing HTTP APIs

### Load Testing
- Concurrent connection capacity testing
- Message throughput and latency testing
- Memory usage under high connection loads
- Failover and recovery testing

## Migration and Integration Notes

When implementing WebSocket functionality:

1. **Integration Points**: WebSocket events should integrate with existing DatabaseAgent operations
2. **Authentication**: Use existing session management and client access patterns  
3. **API Consistency**: WebSocket messages should follow similar patterns to REST API responses
4. **Error Handling**: Apply consistent error handling and logging patterns
5. **Security**: Implement same security measures as HTTP endpoints
