# Conversation-First Architecture
## Vision for Unified Turn Stream with Addressee-Based Interaction

## Core Concept
**"Users log in to converse. They choose WHO to converse with, not WHERE."**

Replace the current "always in a meeting" model with a unified conversation stream where:
- All interactions are turns in a single timeline
- Direction is suggestive (nudge), not restrictive (wall)
- Anyone can respond to any turn
- UI shows addressees/contacts, not meetings

## Data Model Evolution

### Current (Meeting-Centric):
```sql
meetings.meetings (containers)
├── id (required for every turn)
├── type ('cogito_web', 'zoom', etc.)
└── metadata

conversation.turns (content)
├── id
├── meeting_id (required FK)
├── content
└── timestamp
```

### Proposed (Turn-Centric):
```sql
conversation.turns (unified stream)
├── id
├── user_id              -- Who said it
├── content              -- What they said
├── client_id            -- Client context
├── directed_to[]        -- Optional addressees (nullable array)
├── visibility          -- Always 'visible' (no private DMs)
├── response_to_turn_id -- Optional threading
├── timestamp
└── metadata            -- Flexible context (meeting refs, etc.)
```

## UI Transformation

### Current Sidebar (Meeting List):
```
📋 Meetings
├── Daily Standup
├── Code Review Session
├── Client Call - Acme
└── [+ New Meeting]
```

### New Sidebar (Addressee List):
```
💬 Conversations

## Interaction Patterns

### Directed Messages (Nudge, Not Wall):
```
Ken: @Cogito Can you explain this algorithm?
     👁️ Visible to all, Cogito is nudged to respond

Sarah: I actually know this - it's binary search!
       🙋‍♀️ Anyone can respond, even if not directed to them

Cogito: @Ken Sarah's right, and here's the formal analysis...
        🤖 Cogito responds as intended
```

### Open Messages:
```
Ken: What's everyone working on today?
     📢 Open to all team members and AI assistants

Sarah: Finishing the user dashboard
James: Bug fixing in the payment flow  
Cogito: I can help with either if you need analysis
```

## Advanced Features

### Avatar Responses (When Users Offline):
```
Ken: @Sarah What do you think about this approach?

🤖👤 Sarah (AI Avatar): Based on my conversation history, I'd probably say...
                        "This looks similar to our Q3 review discussion.
                         My usual concern would be database scalability..."
                        
                        💡 AI approximation - Real Sarah will see this when online
```

### Meeting Transcripts as Files:
- Poor-quality meeting transcripts stored as files, not forced into turns
- LLM can process full context for better understanding
- Semantic search across meeting archives
- Can extract insights without fragmented turn structure

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Semantic Layer (Immediate)
- Keep current database structure
- Add conversation-first language to UI and code
- Introduce addressee-based interaction concepts

### Phase 2: Data Migration (When Ready)
- Migrate 'cogito_web' meetings → metadata references
- Add directed_to arrays to turns table
- Implement unified turn stream queries

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Real-time presence indicators
- Avatar response system
- Meeting transcript file processing
- Semantic search across all content

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Awkward UX**: No more "select a meeting" before talking
2. **Natural Mental Model**: Like Slack/Discord - pick who to talk to
3. **Flexible Collaboration**: Anyone can join any conversation
4. **AI Integration**: Seamless human-AI collaboration
5. **Async Continuity**: Avatar responses when people offline
6. **Unified Search**: One stream to search across all interactions

## Technical Advantages

- **Simpler Queries**: No complex meeting joins
- **Better Performance**: Single table primary queries
- **Flexible Grouping**: Dynamic conversation threads
- **Richer Context**: Full conversation history accessible
- **Scalable Architecture**: Add new participant types easily
