PARTICIPANT'S QUESTION: "${question}"

Please provide a helpful response that:
- First considers the meeting content and uploaded documents if relevant to the question
- Can draw on your general knowledge when appropriate to give comprehensive answers
- Is conversational and engaging (not limited to just meeting content)
- Can discuss topics beyond what's been covered in the meeting if that would be helpful
- Provides practical insights and actionable information when possible

Be thorough in your response while remaining clear and conversational. If the question relates to people mentioned in the meeting, reference the transcript context, but don't limit yourself only to meeting content if broader knowledge would be valuable.`;

- Key insights or decisions that have emerged
- Notable participant contributions or perspectives
- Any patterns, tensions, or opportunities you observe
- Suggestions for productive next steps if appropriate

Be insightful and analytical while remaining conversational. You can offer observations that go beyond just summarizing what was said - provide value through your analysis of the conversation dynamics and content. If the conversation is light or just starting, acknowledge that and offer to help in other ways.`;
